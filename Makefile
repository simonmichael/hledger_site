# Render most versions of manuals (excluding old versions not packaged anywhere). 
# We want to link only one version in the sidebar, but mdbook won't render (and will remove) unlinked versions.
# We work around this by, for each version,
# temporarily linking that version of the manuals in SUMMARY, rendering the whole site,
# and saving the rendered manuals in out2/VERSION/.
# Re-rendering the whole site is of course wasteful and slow, but ensures all manual versions
# include the up-to-date site sidebar.
# The sitemap files are restored afterward (mdbook removes them).
# The current release should be the last version rendered. Keep synced with site.js:
