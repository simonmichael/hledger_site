# Render most versions of manuals (excluding old unpackaged versions). 
#
# This is fiddly because of how mdbook works. Goals (simplified 2025-08):
# - in the sidebar, link to the current release version of manuals only
# - in the site search, search only the current manuals (ideally the current release version)
# - keep old versions of the manuals out of search engines
#
# mdbook won't render (and will remove rendered versions of) any pages not linked in SUMMARY.
# We work around this by, for each version,
# temporarily linking that version of the manuals in SUMMARY, rendering the whole site,
# and saving the rendered manuals in out2/VERSION/ (which caddy serves as /VERSION/*).
# A limitation: when viewing an old manual, the sidebar manuals links will all be
# to that old version.
# Re-rendering the whole site for each version is of course wasteful and slow,
# but it's how we ensure all manual versions include the latest site sidebar.
#
# Keep this list synced with site.js.
# The current release should be the last version rendered.
# Old hledger versions had seven manuals, newer ones have three.
# mdbook removes the sitemap files, so we rebuild those afterward.
