# Invoicing

Freelancers and businesses send invoices to clients to request payment.
You can use hledger to track how much is due, and how much has been paid.

## Journal entries

### Accrual accounting

Businesses use accrual accounting, where you record revenue (and the tax event)
at the time of invoicing, and you keep track of what is receivable (awaiting payment).

```journal
; send an invoice:
2020-02-01 * (201602ab) AB Inc. | invoice
    revenues:consulting:ab     $-1000
    assets:receivable:ab        $1000

; receive payment:
2020-02-15 * AB Inc. | payment for 201602ab
    assets:receivable:ab       $-1000  ; = $0  ; assert this if fully paid (optional)
    assets:checking             $1000
```

### Cash accounting

Cash accounting is simpler; you record revenue at the time of receiving the money.
Invoices and receivables aren't part of cash accounting,
but we'll use unbalanced postings to track them anyway.

```journal
; send an invoice:
2020-02-01 * (201602ab) AB Inc. | invoice
    (assets:receivable:ab)      $1000

; receive payment:
2020-02-15 * AB Inc. | payment for 201602ab
    (assets:receivable:ab)     $-1000  ; = $0  ; assert this if fully paid (optional)
    revenues:consulting:ab     $-1000
    assets:checking             $1000
```

## Reports

What invoices have been sent and are not yet paid ?
Using either example above
(assuming the payment transaction is commented out):
```shell
$ hledger bal receivable
               $1000  assets:receivable:ab
--------------------
               $1000
```

## Creating Invoices

How to translate the data from your ledger into a professional-looking
invoice you can send to clients ?

You can create the invoice manually or semi-manually, eg using a tool
like Freshbooks, and copy-paste the numbers in.

Or you can automate this somehow. There's no ready-made tool for this,
you will have to build it yourself.

### With pandoc

But here's a method I use to semi-automate the invoice generation.
It still requires some manual work, but much less than otherwise.
The workflow is: 

1. figure out the amount to be invoiced, eg from a timelog report
2. use the makefile below to help create the invoice
3. adjust the invoice transaction which it added to the journal.

This is based on 
[Generate PDF invoices from Markdown using Pandoc](https://martinbetz.eu/article/pandoc-invoices) 
by Martin Betz, see that page for more background.
Some version of the files below can also be found in
[examples/invoicing/](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/tree/master/examples/invoicing).
[Copy-pasted from a working setup, not regularly tested, expect to adapt this].

## Terms

Now due. Your prompt payments are appreciated, thank you!
```

Your text editor probably can make editing markdown convenient.
For example in Emacs with markdown-mode:

- press TAB while in the table to realign it
- to sum the Totals, select them from top left to bottom right, C-x * :
- alternatively, you could probably make a nice yasnippet template for generating the markdown
