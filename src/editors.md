# Editors

If you edit your journals (and other hledger data files) with a [text
editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor), you want that
frequent task to be as pleasant and non-tedious as possible. So it's
worth using a powerful text editor - one with comfortable copy/paste, search
& replace, and perhaps more advanced features like macros.

For the popular text editors there are helper modes/extensions which can make editing
hledger journal files much more convenient. These provide things like
syntactic highlighting, auto indentation, and tab completion of
account names.  You can find a list of these extensions at \
<https://plaintextaccounting.org/#editor-support>.\
The ones with "hledger" in their name are designed specifically for working with hledger journals, while the ones with "ledger" in their name are not, but can often work well with hledger as well (eg: ledger-mode).

Here are more details and tips.

## Emacs

### Ledger-mode

<https://github.com/ledger/ledger-mode>
([manual](http://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger-mode.html)), for
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), is the most used and
maintained helper mode for hledger and Ledger files.

It has some hard-coded dependence on Ledger's command-line interface, so
does not work perfectly with hledger, whose CLI is similar but not
identical.

**1. Basic configuration:**

``` elisp
(setq ledger-binary-path "hledger"
      ledger-mode-should-check-version nil
      ledger-report-auto-width nil
      ledger-report-links-in-register nil
      ledger-report-native-highlighting-arguments '("--color=always"))
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.hledger\\'" . ledger-mode))
```

Or, using use-package:

``` elisp
(use-package ledger-mode
  :custom
  ((ledger-binary-path "hledger")
   (ledger-mode-should-check-version nil)
   (ledger-report-auto-width nil)
   (ledger-report-links-in-register nil)
   (ledger-report-native-highlighting-arguments '("--color=always")))
  :mode ("\\.hledger\\'" "\\.ledger\\'"))
```

This configuration makes ledger-mode commands run hledger, configures
colored output correctly and turns off some incompatible functionality.
Most editing functions in the journal buffer work correctly and so do
most of the reports. Annoyingly, reconcilliation, quick balance display
and the add-transaction prompt fail due to hardcoded ledger-specific
options that hledger doesn't have. Hence the following:

**2. Compatibility script**

Further functionality can be gained by putting the following script in
your PATH and pointing \`ledger-binary-path\` to it.

``` elisp
(setq ledger-binary-path "hledger.sh")
(setq ledger-default-date-string "%Y-%m-%d")
```

The script works by converting command line options and arguments to
hledger's equivalent incantations, or filtering them out. By using it
all the commands in the journal buffer become functional. It enables the
Quick Balance Display (\<C-c\> \<C-p\>), display-ledger-stats (\<C-c\>
\<C-l\>) and Add Transaction (\<C-c\> \<C-p\>) and gets us a step closer
to reconcilliation (still not there tho).

``` shell
#!/bin/sh
# hledger.sh
# Kudos to acarrico for the original script.

# The script is contingent on ledger-default-date-string
# being set to "%Y-%m-%d", aka ISO date format.

iargs=("$@")
oargs=()
j=0;
date=;
for((i=0; i<${#iargs[@]}; ++i)); do
    case ${iargs[i]} in
        --date-format)
            # drop --date-format and the next arg
            i=$((i+1));
            ;;
        cleared) # for ledger-di
            splay-balance-at-point
            # convert "cleared" to "balance -N -C"
            oargs[j]=balance; oargs[j+1]=-N; oargs[j+2]=-C; j=$((j+3));
            ;;
        xact)
            # convert "xact" to "print --match"
            oargs[j]=print; oargs[j+1]=--match; j=$((j+2));
            # drop xact argument and stash the date argument
            i=$((i+1));
            date=${iargs[i]};
            ;;
        # NOTE: Reconciliation still doesn't work for other reasons
        #       so the following filters/conversions are unnecessary for now.
        # --sort) # for reconcilliation
        #     # drop --sort and the next arg
        #     i=$((i+1));
        #     ;;
        # --uncleared) # for reconcilliation
        #     # convert "--uncleared" to "--unmarked --pending"
        #     oargs[j]=--unmarked; oargs[j+1]=--pending; j=$((j+2))
        #     ;;
        *)
            # keep any other args:
            oargs[j]=${iargs[i]};
            j=$((j+1));
            ;;
    esac
done

if test "$date"
then
    # substitute the given date for the old date:
    hledger "${oargs[@]}" | sed "1s/....-..-../$date/"
else
    # echo "${oargs[@]}"
    hledger "${oargs[@]}"
fi

```

**TODO** – Generalize script to work with different date formats

**Feature Compatibility Checklist:**

- [x] **Ledger Buffer**
  - [x] Navigation
  - [x] Completion
  - [x] Set effective date (\<C-c\> \<C-t\>)
  - [x] Quick balance display (\<C-c\> \<C-p\>) – **FAILS due to
    -–date-format, fixed by script**
  - [x] Copy Transaction (\<C-c\> \<C-k\>)
  - [x] Clear Posting/Transaction
  - [x] Delete transaction
  - [x] Sorting transactions
  - [x] Narrowing (i.e. regex filtering)
  - [x] Transaction completion by payee (\<C-c\> \<TAB\>)
  - [x] Add transaction (\<C-c\> \<C-a\>) – **FAILS due to -–date-format,
    fixed by script**
  - [x] display-ledger-stats (\<C-c\> \<C-l\>) – **FAILS due to
    -–date-format, fixed by script**
- [ ] **Report Buffer** (\<C-c\> \<C-o\> \<C-r\>)
  - [x] balance
  - [x] register
  - [ ] payee – **FAILS, hledger uses @item syntax for argument files,
    ledger uses @payee to filter transactions**
  - [x] account
  - [x] custom  
    NOTE: custom report simply opens the minibuffer with the
    word ledger prefilled. It works if you input a valid hledger
    command, but it doesn't use the current buffer filename or anything.
    It does update on buffer changes however. Naming and saving custom
    reports works as well.
    - [ ] Expansion formats
      - [x] %(ledger-file)
      - [x] %(payee)
      - [x] %(account)
      - [ ] %(tag-name) – **TODO: Figure out what/why.**
      - [ ] %(tag-value) – **TODO: Figure out what/why.**
      - [x] %(month)
    - [ ] Jump to transaction from register report – **FAILS, line data
      is passed to emacs using ledger's -–prepend-format**
    - [x] Reversing report order
- [ ] **Reconcile Buffer** – **FAILS due to an assortment of errors**  
  NOTE: Opening the reconcile buffer uses Narrowing (\<C-c\> \<C-f\>) to
  filter transactions to only ones relevant to the selected account.
  After the reconcile buffer errors out filtering needs to be turned off
  with \<C-c\> \<C-f\>.
- [ ] **Scheduling Transactions** – **FAILS -- ledger/hledger UI
  incompatibility**  
  NOTE: ledger has a scheduler for periodic
  transactions which are written in a separate ledger file. Ledger-mode
  provides a way to view and copy those transactions into the main
  journal, making the process of updating the journal with periodic
  transactions somewhat easier. The closest corresponding functionality
  are hledger's periodic transactions and the –forecast option (how easy
  it would be to adapt ledger-mode to it remains to be seen).

**TODO** – Add common hledger reports as custom reports

[#367 ledger-mode setup for hledger needs documenting](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/367) has
more tips to be collected here.  
[hledger-related issues](https://github.com/ledger/ledger-mode/issues?q=label:hledger)

**Errors:**

1.  The –date-format error:  
    ledger-mode hardcodes this option into it's
    ledger incantations. It can be avoided in some, but not all cases.
    Generally the first and most common error you bump into.
2.  –columns: see [\#279](https://github.com/ledger/ledger-mode/issues/279)  
    This error is why (setq ledger-report-auto-width nil) is necessary.
3.  –prepend-format:  
    This is why (setq ledger-report-links-in-register
    nil) is necessary.  
    ledger-mode links register report entries to
    transactions by prepending line data to ledger's output, then
    stripping that data from the buffer and turning the output to links.
    Hledger doesn't have a –prepend-format CLI option.
4.  command emacs is not recognised.  
    This is the next hurdle to
    reconcilliation. ledger-cli has an option to output data, formatted
    for elisp consumption, which the reconcile buffer uses.

### hledger-mode

<https://github.com/narendraj9/hledger-mode>\
An alternative to ledger-mode, written specifically for hledger. Has some different features. Less actively maintained.

### flycheck-hledger

<https://github.com/DamienCassou/flycheck-hledger> (2021)
provides realtime indication of problems in your journal.
It can be used with ledger-mode or hledger-mode.

``C-x ` `` steps to the next problem in the current file.\
``C-u C-x ` `` restarts the scan from the top.\
A description should appear in the  message area, 
but Emacs may hide it behind "...locus..." messages;
you can fix that by customising the `next-error-verbose` variable to off.

Sample config:
```elisp
(use-package flycheck-hledger
  :after (flycheck ledger-mode)  ; or hledger-mode
  :ensure t
  :demand t
  :custom
  (flycheck-hledger-strict t) 
  (flycheck-hledger-checks '("ordereddates" "recentassertions"))   ; extra checks from https://hledger.org/hledger.html#check: ordereddates, uniqueleafnames, payees, recentassertions, tags..
  ;(flycheck-hledger-executable "hledger")
  )
```

Currently flycheck-hledger always runs hledger with the `--auto` flag,
so be aware that any auto posting rules will be active.

### flymake-hledger

<https://github.com/DamienCassou/flymake-hledger/> (2023)
is a more recent alternative to flycheck-hledger, using the built-in Flymake
rather than the third-party Flycheck feature.

Here are some early configuration notes, using use-package:

```elisp
;; Enable verbose use-package debug info when starting with --debug-init
;; (when init-file-debug
;;   (setq use-package-verbose t
;;         use-package-expand-minimally nil
;;         use-package-compute-statistics t
;;         debug-on-error t))

;; Configure flycheck-like keybindings for flymake:
(use-package flymake
  :bind (
         :map flymake-mode-map
         ("C-c ! n" . flymake-goto-next-error)
         ("C-c ! p" . flymake-goto-prev-error)
         ("C-c ! l" . flymake-show-buffer-diagnostics)  ; a new list for each buffer, unlike flycheck
         ("C-c ! v" . flymake-switch-to-log-buffer)))

(use-package flymake-hledger
  :load-path "~/src/flymake-hledger"
  :after (ledger-mode flymake)

  :hook (
  (ledger-mode . flymake-hledger-enable)
  ;; Make C-x ` work ?
  ;; XXX Both of these work only in the first file opened; debugging needed.
  ;; (ledger-mode . (lambda () (setq next-error-function 'flymake-goto-next-error)))
  ;; (ledger-mode . (lambda () (setq next-error-function (lambda (num reset) (when reset (goto-char (point-min))) (flymake-goto-next-error num)))))
  )

  :custom
  (flymake-show-diagnostics-at-end-of-line t)  ; might require Emacs 30
  (flymake-suppress-zero-counters t)
  (flymake-hledger-checks '("accounts" "commodities" "balancednoautoconversion" "ordereddates")) ; "recentassertions" "payees" "tags" "uniqueleafnames" https://hledger.org/hledger.html#check
  )
```

To extra checks for a specific journal file, add a line like this near the top:
```elisp
; -*- eval:(add-to-list 'flymake-hledger-checks "recentassertions" t); -*-
```

### org babel

org babel (ob) is the system for evaluating code blocks embedded in org outlines.
ob-hledger.el adds hledger support, so that
hledger reports can be embedded within an org outline, 
and easily evaluated inline or exported in various formats.
If you have many reports, this can be a nice way to save and organise and interactively update them.

In 2021 a number of org addons including ob-hledger.el were moved from org to the separate org-contrib package. 
As of 2025 the primary hosting for this seems to be <https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/org-contrib>.
Here are the [ob-hledger.el changes](https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/org-contrib/log/master/item/lisp/ob-hledger.el).

To enable org-contrib in emacs:

- `M-x list-packages`, install org-contrib
- In your emacs config, add: `(require 'ob-hledger)`\
  (and evaluate it with `C-M-x`, or a restart)
- In any org file, add hledger commands like this:

    ```
    #+begin_src hledger :cmdline -f ~/finance/2022.journal balance
    #+end_src
    ```
- To evaluate the command inline, press `C-c C-c` with point (cursor) inside the above line
- To update all such reports in the file, press `C-c C-v b`
- To export all reports:
  - as html, and open in browser:   `C-c C-e h o`
  - as html:                        `C-c C-e h h`
  - as UTF-8 text:                  `C-c C-e t U` 
  - as markdown (if configured):    `C-c C-e m o`
  - etc.
- To export only the reports in the current subtree:
  - configure it at top of org file: `# -*- org-export-initial-scope:subtree; -*-`)
  - put point in the desired subtree before exporting as above

### calc

Calc can help perform arithmetic on amounts in the buffer during data entry.
Position the cursor anywhere in the number, then use `C-x * w` to enter embedded Calc mode, and `q` to exit.

Eg to halve an amount: put cursor at the number, then `C-x w * 2 / q`

Note Calc rewrites decimal numbers to a standard format, hiding trailing zeros by default, which you may not want.
To preserve trailing zeros, you must force a fixed number of decimal digits. 
In calc mode (eg before pressing q above) do:
- `d f 2 return`   to force two digits (eg shows .00)
- `d f 3 return`   to force three digits (eg shows .005 when there's a half cent)
- `d n`            to choose normal mode (shows all digits except trailing zeros)

And to ensure that such config changes are saved in (and reloaded from) ~/.emacs.d/calc.el rather than the current buffer, add this to your emacs config:
```lisp
(setq calc-mode-save-mode 'save)
```
