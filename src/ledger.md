# hledger and Ledger
<div class=pagetoc>

<!-- toc -->
</div>

hledger was inspired by the app that pioneered plain text accounting: Ledger (<https://ledger-cli.org>).
This page describes differences between them, and a little history.

If you are a Ledger user trying to use hledger with your data,
feel free to skip ahead to [Interoperating tips](#interoperating-tips).
And please let me know your experience in the [#hledger or #plaintextaccounting chats](support.md).

## Differences

### 10000 foot view

How is hledger different from Ledger ? First, the high-order differences:

- hledger is actively maintained (since 2008)
- hledger focusses strongly on UX, reliability, and real-world practicality
- hledger is written in Haskell, which helps with correctness and maintainability
- hledger tries to reimplement Ledger's best parts in more depth, with improved functionality and robustness.

Compared to Ledger, hledger has

- a complete and accurate manual
- standard "financial statement" reports
- multi-column reports
- an easier query syntax 
- better depth limiting
- a battle-tested CSV/SSV/TSV import system
- and comes with multiple officially-supported user interfaces (CLI, TUI, WUI, HTTP-JSON).

Compared to hledger, Ledger has

- assisted lot tracking for investment transactions
- more support for embedding small programs in your data to get custom behaviour 
  (value expressions, maybe python expressions ?)
- smaller executables.

### Feature differences

Over time, features have propagated both ways.
These features are common to both hledger and Ledger:

- command line interface
- journal, timeclock, csv input formats
- csv conversion rules
- text, csv output formats
- multiple commodities
- costs and cost reporting
- market prices and value reporting
- virtual/unbalanced postings
- automated postings
- periodic transactions
- budget reporting
- unrealised capital gains reporting
- report filtering with flags and query arguments
- basic output format customisation
- commands: accounts, balance, commodities, payees, prices, print, register, stats, tags

For differences, see the detailed [PTA Feature Matrix](https://plaintextaccounting.org/#feature-matrix).

The [Features](features.md) page introduces hledger's features for new users.

### Performance differences

Ledger was traditionally faster than hledger with large files, eg above 5k transactions.
(Many people record about 1-2k transactions per year.)
Ledger's speed came partly from providing fewer guarantees, eg Ledger's balance assertions/assignments are not date-aware.

Since about 2021 the performance gap seems to me to have closed or reversed,
at least on my mac, where hledger often runs faster and in less memory than Ledger,
especially with very large files.

In 2022, hledger ~1.25 compiled natively on a macbook air m1 processed 25k transactions per second:
```cli
$ hledger --version
hledger 1.24.99.2-gba5b0e93f-20220205, mac-aarch64

Tue Feb  8 11:03:57 HST 2022
```

Newer hledger versions are slower than this.
hledger 1.29-1.32.2 have a performance bug which can be seen with large files,
[#2153](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/2153)
(see eg [2153#issuecomment-1912942305](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/2153#issuecomment-1912942305) benchmarks).

2024's hledger 1.40 on macbook air m1 runs at roughly 16k txns/s for me:

```cli
$ hledger -f examples/100ktxns-1kaccts.journal stats
Main file           : .../100ktxns-1kaccts.journal
Included files      : 0

Runtime stats       : 6.23 s elapsed, 16051 txns/s, 258 MB live, 773 MB alloc
```

More independent benchmarking is needed, help welcome.

### Command line differences

- hledger does not require a space between command-line flags and their values,
  eg `-fFILE` works as well as `-f FILE`

- hledger uses `--ignore-assertions`/`-I` to disable balance assertions. 
  Ledger uses `--permissive` for that, and uses `-I` as the short form of `--prices`.

- hledger's `-x`/`--explicit` flag makes print show all amounts;
  Ledger's `--explicit` flag does something else.

- hledger's and Ledger's `-H`/`--historical` flags are unrelated.
  hledger's `-H` makes register and balance-like commands include
  balances from before the report start date, instead of starting at
  zero:

      hledger register --help:
      -H --historical           show historical running total/balance
                                (includes postings before report start date)

      hledger balance --help:
      -H --historical           show historical ending balance in each period
                                (includes postings before report start date)

  Whereas Ledger's `-H` changes the valuation date used by `-V`/`-X`:

      ledger --help:
      --historical (-H)
                                Value commodities at the time of their acquisition.

- hledger's [query language](hledger.md#queries) is a little less
  powerful than Ledger's, simpler, and easier to remember.
  It uses google-like prefixes, such as `desc:`, `payee:`, `amt:`, and `not:`.
  Multiple query terms are combined using fixed AND/OR rules.
  More complex query combinations with AND/OR/NOT can be expressed with `expr:"BOOLEANEXPR"`.
  Some complex queries can also be achieved by using two invocations of hledger in a pipe, eg:
  `hledger print QUERY1 | hledger -f- -I reg QUERY2`

- hledger provides more short flags (`-b`, `-e`, `-p`, `-D`, `-W`, `-M`, `-Q`, `-Y`) and the `date:` query argument for setting report period and interval, and all of these combine nicely.

- hledger handles the transaction/posting status mark more precisely,
  fixing a [recurring source of confusion](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/564):
  It calls the three statuses "unmarked", "pending", "cleared",
  and provides corresponding `--unmarked`/`-U`, `--pending`/`-P`, and `--cleared`/`-C` flags, which can be combined.
  Ledger's `-U`, which matches things not cleared, is `-UP` in hledger.
  hledger's `-U` matches things with no status mark, which can't easily be done in Ledger.

### Journal format differences

hledger's journal format mimics (a subset of) Ledger's quite closely.
You can maintain a journal file that works with both hledger and Ledger simultaneously,
if you restrict yourself to compatible features,
perhaps keeping non-compatible features in separate files.

A typical gnarly old Ledger file will not work with hledger as-is.
Here are some of the roadbumps to expect (see also: [#1752](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1752)):

- Some features are supported only by one or the other (Ledger's `(AMOUNTEXPR)`, `((VALUEEXPR))`.. , hledger's `==`, `=*`, `==*`..)
- Some will be accepted but ignored, probably causing transactions not to balance (`{LOTCOST}`, `{=LOTFIXEDCOST}`, `[LOTDATE]`, `(LOTNOTE)`..)
- Some may be interpreted differently (balance assertions, balance assignments..)
- Some may have different restrictions (dates, comments..)

You'll find lots of tips for how to handle these and other differences, below.

But first, an overview of Ledger's (extensive) journal format.
Here are its features, from the [Ledger manual](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html) (2022-12),
and their supportedness in hledger (1.40, 2024-09):
Y (supported), Ignored (accepted but ignored), or N (not accepted).

### Decoding errors

hledger, like most Haskell programs, exits with a confusing error message
if it sees non-ascii data
and the system locale is not configured to decode UTF-8.
If your data contains non-ascii characters and hledger gives an error
such as "invalid byte sequence", "mkTextEncoding: invalid argument" or similar,
you must [configure your locale](https://hledger.org/install.html#check-your-locale).

### Tabs and spaces

In places which normally require two or more spaces (or tabs),
eg between account name and amount,
ledger will also accept a single tab character. 
But hledger always requires two or more spaces or tabs (ensuring a visually distinct gap).
So you might need to add a space in such cases.

### Decimal mark

Ledger parses `1,000` as 1000, but hledger parses it as 1, by default
(see [hledger > Decimal marks](hledger.md#decimal-marks)).

To prevent any undetected disagreements, 
use [commodity directives](#commodity-directives) or [decimal-mark directives](hledger.md#decimal-mark-directive)
to disambiguate the decimal mark character during parsing.

### Balancing precision

Ledger and hledger can occasionally disagree on whether a transaction is balanced.
In this journal, $'s precision (number of decimal places) is 2 in txn1, 4 in txn2, and 4 globally:

```journal
2022-01-01 txn1
    expenses                                 AAA 989.02 @ $1.123456  ; $1111.12045312
    checking                                  $-1111.12

2022-01-02 txn2
    expenses                                      $0.1234
    checking
```

Ledger checks transaction balancedness using local precisions only,
so it balances with precision 2, and accepts txn1's $-0.00045312 imbalance.

hledger checks transaction balancedness using global precisions,
so it balances with precision 4, and rejects txn1's imbalance.
To read these entries with hledger, you have to limit \$'s global precision,
by adding `-c '\$0.00'` to the command (easiest when piping)
or `commodity $0.00` to the file (more permanent, when creating a new file).

### Balance assertions / assignments

Ledger calculates balance assignments and checks balance assertions simply in the order they were parsed.
hledger calculates balance assignments and checks balance assertions in date order
and then (for postings on the same date) parse order.
This ensures correct, reliable behaviour independent of the ordering of journal entries and files. 

hledger correctly handles multiple balance assignments/assertions within a single transaction.

Ledger rejects the following balance assertion, as if `(a)` and `a` were different accounts; hledger does not.
```journal
2023-01-01
  (a)  1

2023-01-02
  a    1 = 2
  b
```

In addition to `=`, hledger supports several other kinds of balance assertion, with syntax `==`, `=*` and `==*`. Ledger rejects these.

hledger allows `@`/`@@` cost notation in balance assertion/assignment amounts,
ie to the right of the equals sign; Ledger does not.

hledger adds a restriction on balance assignments:
it does not allow balance assignments on accounts affected by auto posting rules
(since in general this can make balancing the journal impossible).

### Directive scope

The region affected by directives, and their behaviour with included files or sibling files,
is sometimes different in hledger. This is to ensure robust, predictable behaviour.
Here are hledger's [Directive effects](dev/hledger.html#directive-effects) and 
[Directives and multiple files](hledger.md#directives-and-multiple-files) behaviour.
You might need to move directives and/or rearrange your files.

### Commodity directives

hledger allows `commodity` directives with a `format` subdirective to be written as one line,
eg these are equivalent:

```journal
commodity JPY
  format 1.00 JPY

commodity 1.00 JPY
```

hledger's commodity directive currently ignores other subdirectives (eg `alias`).

hledger's commodity directive always requires a decimal mark in the amount.
To display no decimal digits, write the decimal mark at the end:

```journal
commodity 1000. JPY
```

And as [mentioned above](#decimal-mark), hledger assumes a single period or comma is a decimal mark,
so when specifying digit group marks, write a decimal mark as well:
Eg:

```journal
commodity 1,000. JPY
```

See also: [hledger > `commodity` directive](hledger.md#commodity-directive).

### Periodic transactions

hledger understands most Ledger periodic transactions,
but if you find some variants that are not supported, please report.

When you do specify a custom start date, hledger will start the transactions on that date.
Ledger seems to always generate them on the period boundaries.

### Amount expressions

hledger does not support value expressions, Ledger's embedded programming language.
In particular, parenthesised amount expressions like `($10 / 3)` are not supported;
these must be converted to explicit amounts. Here are the known ways:

- Convert each expression manually, eg replace `($10 / 3)` with `$3.333`.

- Convert each expression with ledger.
  Eg in emacs, select the parenthesised expression and enter `C-u M-| xargs ledger eval` (and remove the newline).
  This might not work in all cases.

- Convert all expressions with beancount.
  This is a lossy conversion, but it might be good enough.
  After installing 
  ledger2beancount,
  beancount,
  and beancount2ledger (see #[33](https://github.com/beancount/beancount2ledger/issues/33)),
  try:
  ```cli
  $ ledger2beancount file.ledger > file.beancount
  $ beancount2ledger file.beancount > file.journal
  ```

### Lot notation

hledger currently does not provide automatic lot selection or a `--lots` report; 
instead you must track them manually, recording cost basis with `@`
and using explicit per-lot subaccounts and gain/loss postings
(see <https://hledger.org/investments.html>).

<!--
hledger does not automatically calculate capital gains when selling
a lot at a different price from its cost basis, as Ledger does.
```journal
; Ledger expects the 5 EUR capital gain income here because selling a 10 EUR lot at 15 EUR.
; hledger does not. Must leave that amount implicit to allow both to parse this.
2019-03-01 Sell
  Assets:Shares           -1 ETF {10 EUR} @ 15 EUR
  Assets:Cash             15 EUR
  Income:Capital Gains   ;-5 EUR
```
-->

More importantly, hledger ignores Ledger's lot notation, like `-5 AAPL {$50.00} [2012/04/10] (Oh my!) @@ $375.00`.
(Any of `{LOTUNITCOST}`, `{{LOTTOTALCOST}}`, `{=FIXEDLOTUNITCOST}`, `{{=FIXEDLOTTOTALCOST}}`, `[LOTDATE]`, `(LOTNOTE)` after a posting amount).
This can disrupt transaction balancing, making files unreadable.
([#1084](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1084))
For now the only true workaround is to rewrite such entries to use hledger-style explicit lot notation.

### Other differences

- hledger's input data formats (journal, timeclock, timedot, ...) are separate;
  you can't mix timeclock entries and journal entries in one file as in Ledger.
  (Though a journal file can `include` a timeclock file.)
  This helps implement more useful error messages.
  
- hledger supports international number formats, auto-detecting the
  decimal mark (comma or period), digit group mark (period, comma, or
  space) and digit group sizes to use for each commodity. Or, these can
  be declared explicitly with commodity directives.

- hledger's default commodity directive (D) sets the commodity to be
  used for subsequent commodityless amounts, and also sets that
  commodity's display settings if such an amount is the first
  seen. Ledger uses D only for commodity display settings and for the
  entry command.

- hledger [auto postings](hledger.md#auto-postings) allow only
  minimal customisation of the amount (just multiplying the matched
  amount by a constant), not a full embedded expression language like
  Ledger. (And we call them "auto" to avoid "automatic" vs "automated" confusion.)

- In multi-period reports, hledger expands the report start/end dates
  to span whole periods.

- hledger's print command always shows both the primary transaction date and any secondary date, in their usual positions.
  Ledger's print command with `--aux-date` replaces the primary date with any secondary date.

- hledger always shows time balances (from timeclock or timedot data) in hours.

- hledger always splits multi-day time sessions at midnight, to show the per-day amounts.
  Ledger does this only with the `--day-break` flag.

- hledger's [CSV/TSV/SSV-reading](hledger.md#csv-format) and [import](hledger.md#import) system is more mature and flexible than Ledger's [`convert` command](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#The-convert-command).

- Ledger can report multiple errors at once; hledger reports only one error at a time.

- Ledger can also output warnings. hledger does not print warnings; it either succeeds or fails.

- hledger will complain if transaction or posting comments contain `date:` or `date2:`
  not followed by a valid [date tag value](/hledger.html#posting-dates).

## Interoperating tips

The core of hledger's and Ledger's journal formats is the same, so you
can use both tools on the same files, if you are careful to avoid
tool-specific features.

When you can't avoid tool-specific syntax, you can put it in separate tool-specific files,
and have both of these [include](hledger.md#include-directive) a shared common file.
(Eg 2023.ledger and 2023.hledger, both including 2023.journal).

A third approach is to do a one-way conversion to a new file,
using whatever edits and transformations are necessary,
and automate it as much as possible (with sed, perl, Emacs macros, or similar),
so you can redo the conversion when needed, perhaps incrementally.

### Ledger to hledger

Most Ledger users will have at least some Ledger-specific syntax,
so the quickest way  to tap into hledger reports may be:

```
$ ledger print --raw | hledger -f- -I CMD
```

The print command omits directives.
`--raw` prevents decimal zeroes being added to amounts and disrupting transaction balancing.
`-I` disables checking of balance assertions (if needed).
If this works you can do quick reporting like so:

```cli
$ ledger print --raw | hledger -f- check       # check for problems
$ ledger print --raw | hledger -f- stats       # show journal statistics
$ ledger print --raw | hledger -f- is -MAS -2  # summarise monthly revenues/expenses
$ ledger print --raw | hledger -f- web         # view journal in hledger-web WUI
$ hledger-ui -f <(ledger print --raw)          # view journal in hledger-ui TUI (works in bash)
```

Some common problems:

- hledger does not support Ledger's amount expressions, like `($10 / 3)`.
  If you have those, see [Amount expressions](#amount-expressions) above.

- hledger does not support all of Ledger's lot notation,
  like `-5 AAPL {$50.00} [2012/04/10] (Oh my!) @@ $375.00`.
  It can parse it, but will ignore it, so transaction balancing will probably fail.
  For now the only true workaround is to rewrite such entries to use hledger-style lot notation.
  See [Lot notation](#lot-notation) above.

### hledger to Ledger

Currently there's no specific output format for Ledger; use `print`'s standard `txt` output format.

```cli
$ hledger print | ledger --permissive -f - CMD
```
Ledger requires a space between `-f` and `-`.
`--permissive` disables checking of balance assertions (if needed).

Some common problems:

- hledger's extended balance assertions (`=*`, `==`, `==*`) are not supported
  by Ledger and must be avoided or commented out (eg with `sed -E -e 's/(==|=\*)/; \1/'`).

- Transactions which hledger considers balanced (using global display precisions)
  can be considered unbalanced by Ledger (using local display precisions)
  (see [Balancing precision](#balancing-precision)).
  Try to make those transaction amounts more precise so that they balance in both.

- hledger print will add a trailing decimal mark to amounts with digit
  group marks and no decimal digits, to disambiguate them (since
  1.31), but Ledger
  [currently](https://github.com/ledger/ledger/issues/2301) does not
  parse such numbers.  You can avoid them by suppressing digit group
  marks (eg with `-c`) or by ensuring some decimal digits (eg with
  `--round`); see [hledger > Trailing decimal marks](hledger.md#trailing-decimal-marks).

## History

I (Simon) discovered John Wiegley's [Ledger](http://ledger-cli.org) in 2006,
and was very happy to find this efficient command-line reporting tool with a transparent data format. Initially, I used it to generate time reports for my job. Before long I wanted some improvements - splitting sessions at day boundaries, reporting in hours, etc.

Meanwhile, John was now busy elsewhere. For a long time the Ledger project remained stalled, with unfixed functionality/documentation bugs and an ever-looming v3 release making life hard for new users and creating friction for community growth.
I did what I could to help - reporting bugs, providing support, contributing a [domain and website](https://ledger-cli.org) - but I didn't want to invest in learning C++.

I was learning and investing time in [Haskell](https://haskell.org), and I felt Ledger could be perhaps implemented well, and perhaps more effectively in the long run, in this language.
I urgently needed a rock solid, hassle-free and enjoyable accounting tool.
Also, I wanted a more active project and some way to make progress on the roadbumps and confusion facing other newcomers.

Of course I tried a little shiny-tech salesmanship on John, but couldn't expect him to start over. (At that time he was deeply in the C++ world; nowadays he is a Haskell expert!)

So in 2007 I began experimenting.
I built a toy parser in a few different languages, and it was easiest in Haskell.
I kept tinkering.
Goals included:

1. to get better at Haskell by building something useful to me
2. to implement at least the basic core of Ledger, adapted for my needs
3. to learn how well Haskell could work for real-world applications

And later:

4. to provide a new highly-compatible implementation of at least the basics of Ledger, useful to others, with a greater focus on ease of use, reliability, documentation and web presence
5. to experiment with new user interfaces, APIs, etc.

Before too long I had a tool that was useful to me. With Ledger still installed,
and by maintaining high compatibility, I now had two implementations which could be compared at times of confusion about functionality or suspected bugs/bookkeeping errors, which was quite valuable.

Later, John returned for a while and finished Ledger version 3, the Ledger project attracted new contributors and maintainers, and incremental improvements resumed. I continued sharing discoveries and design discussions, and we have seen many ideas propagating in both directions. I think having independent but compatible implementations has been
quite helpful for troubleshooting, exploring the design space, and growing the community.
For a while I ran [LedgerTips](http://twitter.com/LedgerTips) on twitter.

hledger shared #ledger's IRC channel until 2014, when I created 
the [#hledger](http://irc.hledger.org) channel (now accessible on Libera IRC and Matrix).

In 2016 I set up https://plaintextaccounting.org as a common entry point and information hub.

The further adventures in hledger's development are not yet told, other than in the commit log, issue tracker and mail list, but other contributors joined the project and [CREDITS](CREDITS.md) notes some of their work.
