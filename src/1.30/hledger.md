## NAME

hledger - robust, friendly plain text accounting (CLI version)

## SYNOPSIS

`hledger`\
`hledger COMMAND     [OPTS] [ARGS]`\
`hledger ADDONCMD -- [OPTS] [ARGS]`

## DESCRIPTION

*\[Quick reference links: [Options](#options),
[Commands](#part-4-commands), [Queries](#queries), [Regular
expressions](#regular-expressions), [Period
expressions](#period-expressions), [Journal](#journal),
[Directives](#directives), [CSV](#csv), [Timeclock](#timeclock),
[Timedot](#timedot), [Common tasks](#common-tasks)\]*

hledger is a robust, user-friendly, cross-platform set of programs for
tracking money, time, or any other commodity, using double-entry
accounting and a simple, editable file format. hledger is inspired by
and largely compatible with ledger(1), and largely interconvertible with
beancount(1).

This manual is for hledger\'s command line interface, version 1.30. It
also describes the common options, file formats and concepts used by all
hledger programs. It might accidentally teach you some
bookkeeping/accounting as well! You don\'t need to know everything in
here to use hledger productively, but when you have a question about
functionality, this doc should answer it. It is detailed, so do skip
ahead or skim when needed. You can read it on hledger.org, or as an info
manual or man page on your system. You can also get it from hledger
itself with\
`hledger --man`, `hledger --info` or `hledger help [TOPIC]`.

The main function of the hledger CLI is to read plain text files
describing financial transactions, crunch the numbers, and print a
useful report on the terminal (or save it as HTML, CSV, JSON or SQL).
Many reports are available, as subcommands. hledger will also detect
other `hledger-*` executables as extra subcommands.

hledger usually reads from (and appends to) a journal file specified by
the `LEDGER_FILE` environment variable (defaulting to
`$HOME/.hledger.journal`); or you can specify files with `-f` options.
It can also read timeclock files, timedot files, or any CSV/SSV/TSV file
with a date field.

Here is a small journal file describing one transaction:

``` journal
2015-10-16 bought food
  expenses:food          $10
  assets:cash
```

Transactions are dated movements of money (etc.) between two or more
*accounts*: bank accounts, your wallet, revenue/expense categories,
people, etc. You can choose any account names you wish, using `:` to
indicate subaccounts. There must be at least two spaces between account
name and amount. Positive amounts are inflow to that account (*debit*),
negatives are outflow from it (*credit*). (Some reports show revenue,
liability and equity account balances as negative numbers as a result;
this is normal.)

hledger's add command can help you add transactions, or you can install
other data entry UIs like hledger-web or hledger-iadd. For more
extensive/efficient changes, use a text editor: Emacs + ledger-mode,
VIM + vim-ledger, or VS Code + hledger-vscode are some good choices (see
<https://hledger.org/editors.html>).

To get started, run `hledger add` and follow the prompts, or save some
entries like the above in `$HOME/.hledger.journal`, then try commands
like:\
`hledger print -x`\
`hledger aregister assets`\
`hledger balance`\
`hledger balancesheet`\
`hledger incomestatement`.\
Run `hledger` to list the commands. See also the \"Starting a journal
file\" and \"Setting opening balances\" sections in [PART 5: COMMON
TASKS](#part-5-common-tasks).

## PART 1: USER INTERFACE

## Input

hledger reads one or more data files, each time you run it. You can
specify a file with `-f`, like so

``` shell
$ hledger -f FILE print
```

Files are most often in hledger\'s journal format, with the `.journal`
file extension (`.hledger` or `.j` also work); these files describe
transactions, like an accounting general journal.

When no file is specified, hledger looks for `.hledger.journal` in your
home directory.

But most people prefer to keep financial files in a dedicated folder,
perhaps with version control. Also, starting a new journal file each
year is common (it\'s not required, but helps keep things fast and
organised). So we usually configure a different journal file, by setting
the `LEDGER_FILE` environment variable, to something like
`~/finance/2023.journal`. For more about how to do that on your system,
see [Common tasks \> Setting LEDGER_FILE](#setting-ledger_file).

### Data formats

Usually the data file is in hledger\'s journal format, but it can be in
any of the supported file formats, which currently are:

| Reader:     | Reads:                                                           | Used for file extensions:                                   |
|---------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `journal`   | hledger journal files and some Ledger journals, for transactions | `.journal` `.j` `.hledger` `.ledger`                        |
| `timeclock` | timeclock files, for precise time logging                        | `.timeclock`                                                |
| `timedot`   | timedot files, for approximate time logging                      | `.timedot`                                                  |
| `csv`       | CSV/SSV/TSV/character-separated values, for data import          | `.csv` `.ssv` `.tsv` `.csv.rules` `.ssv.rules` `.tsv.rules` |

These formats are described in more detail below.

hledger detects the format automatically based on the file extensions
shown above. If it can\'t recognise the file extension, it assumes
`journal` format. So for non-journal files, it\'s important to use a
recognised file extension, so as to either read successfully or to show
relevant error messages.

You can also force a specific reader/format by prefixing the file path
with the format and a colon. Eg, to read a .dat file as csv format:

``` shell
$ hledger -f csv:/some/csv-file.dat stats
```

### Standard input

The file name `-` means standard input:

``` shell
$ cat FILE | hledger -f- print
```

If reading non-journal data in this way, you\'ll need to add a file
format prefix, like:

``` shell
$ echo 'i 2009/13/1 08:00:00' | hledger print -f timeclock:-
```

### Multiple files

You can specify multiple `-f` options, to read multiple files as one big
journal. When doing this, note that certain features (described below)
will be affected:

-   [Balance assertions](#balance-assertions) will not see the effect of
    transactions in previous files. (Usually this doesn\'t matter as
    each file will set the corresponding opening balances.)
-   Some [directives](#directives) will not affect previous or
    subsequent files.

If needed, you can work around these by using a single parent file which
[includes](#include-directive) the others, or concatenating the files into
one, eg: `cat a.journal b.journal | hledger -f- CMD`.

### Strict mode

hledger checks input files for valid data. By default, the most
important errors are detected, while still accepting easy journal files
without a lot of declarations:

-   Are the input files parseable, with valid syntax ?
-   Are all transactions balanced ?
-   Do all balance assertions pass ?

With the `-s`/`--strict` flag, additional checks are performed:

-   Are all accounts posted to, declared with an `account` directive ?
    ([Account error checking](#account-error-checking))
-   Are all commodities declared with a `commodity` directive ?
    ([Commodity error checking](#commodity-error-checking))
-   Are all commodity conversions declared explicitly ?

You can use the [check](#check) command to run individual checks \-- the
ones listed above and some more.

## Commands

hledger provides various subcommands for getting things done. Most of
these commands do not change the journal file; they just read it and
output a report. A few commands assist with adding data and file
management.

To show the commands list, run `hledger` with no arguments. The commands
are described in detail in [PART 4: COMMANDS](#part-4-commands), below.

To use a particular command, run `hledger CMD [CMDOPTS] [CMDARGS]`,

-   CMD is the full command name, or its standard abbreviation shown in
    the commands list, or any unambiguous prefix of the name.

-   CMDOPTS are command-specific options, if any. Command-specific
    options must be written after the command name. Eg:
    `hledger print -x`.

-   CMDARGS are additional arguments to the command, if any. Most
    hledger commands accept arguments representing a [query](#queries),
    to limit the data in some way. Eg: `hledger reg assets:checking`.

To list a command\'s options, arguments, and documentation in the
terminal, run `hledger CMD -h`. Eg: `hledger bal -h`.

### Add-on commands

In addition to the built-in commands, you can install *add-on commands*:
programs or scripts named \"hledger-SOMETHING\", which will also appear
in hledger\'s commands list. If you used the [hledger-install
script](https://hledger.org/install.html#build-methods), you will have
several add-ons installed already. Some more can be found in hledger\'s
bin/ directory, documented at <https://hledger.org/scripts.html>.

More precisely, add-on commands are programs or scripts in your shell\'s
PATH, whose name starts with \"hledger-\" and ends with no extension or
a recognised extension (\".bat\", \".com\", \".exe\", \".hs\", \".js\",
\".lhs\", \".lua\", \".php\", \".pl\", \".py\", \".rb\", \".rkt\", or
\".sh\"), and (on unix and mac) which has executable permission for the
current user.

You can run add-on commands using hledger, much like built-in commands:
`hledger ADDONCMD [-- ADDONCMDOPTS] [ADDONCMDARGS]`. But note the double
hyphen argument, required before add-on-specific options. Eg:
`hledger ui -- --watch` or `hledger web -- --serve`. If this causes
difficulty, you can always run the add-on directly, without using
`hledger`: `hledger-ui --watch` or `hledger-web --serve`.

## Options

Run `hledger -h` to see general command line help, and general options
which are common to most hledger commands. These options can be written
anywhere on the command line. They can be grouped into help, input, and
reporting options:

### General help options

`-h --help`

    effects)

`--today=DATE`
:   override today\'s date (affects relative smart dates, for
    tests/examples)

`-U --unmarked`
:   include only unmarked postings/txns (can combine with -P or -C)

`-P --pending`
:   include only pending postings/txns

`-C --cleared`
:   include only cleared postings/txns

`-R --real`
:   include only non-virtual postings

`-NUM --depth=NUM`
:   hide/aggregate accounts or postings more than NUM levels deep

`-E --empty`
:   show items with zero amount, normally hidden (and vice-versa in
    hledger-ui/hledger-web)

`-B --cost`
:   convert amounts to their cost/selling amount at transaction time

`-V --market`
:   convert amounts to their market value in default valuation
    commodities

`-X --exchange=COMM`
:   convert amounts to their market value in commodity COMM

`--value`
:   convert amounts to cost or market value, more flexibly than -B/-V/-X

`--infer-equity`
:   infer conversion equity postings from costs

`--infer-costs`
:   infer costs from conversion equity postings

`--infer-market-prices`
:   use costs as additional market prices, as if they were P directives

`--forecast`
:   generate transactions from [periodic
    rules](hledger.html#periodic-transactions),
:   between the latest recorded txn and 6 months from today,
:   or during the specified PERIOD (= is required).
:   Auto posting rules will be applied to these transactions as well.
:   Also, in hledger-ui make future-dated transactions visible.

`--auto`
:   generate extra postings by applying [auto posting
    rules](hledger.html#auto-postings) to all txns (not just forecast
    txns)

`--verbose-tags`
:   add visible tags indicating transactions or postings which have been
    generated/modified

`--commodity-style`
:   Override the commodity style in the output for the specified
    commodity. For example \'EUR1.000,00\'.

`--color=WHEN (or --colour=WHEN)`
:   Should color-supporting commands use ANSI color codes in text
    output.
:   \'auto\' (default): whenever stdout seems to be a color-supporting
    terminal.
:   \'always\' or \'yes\': always, useful eg when piping output into
    \'less -R\'.
:   \'never\' or \'no\': never.
:   A NO_COLOR environment variable overrides this.

`--pretty[=WHEN]`
:   Show prettier output, e.g. using unicode box-drawing characters.
:   Accepts \'yes\' (the default) or \'no\' (\'y\', \'n\', \'always\',
    \'never\' also work).
:   If you provide an argument you must use \'=\', e.g.
    \'\--pretty=yes\'.

When a reporting option appears more than once in the command line, the
last one takes precedence.

Some reporting options can also be written as [query
arguments](hledger.html#queries).

## Command line tips

Here are some details useful to know about for hledger command lines
(and elsewhere). Feel free to skip this section until you need it.

### Special characters

#### Single escaping (shell metacharacters)

In shell command lines, characters significant to your shell - such as
spaces, `<`, `>`, `(`, `)`, `|`, `$` and `\` - should be
\"shell-escaped\" if you want hledger to see them. This is done by
enclosing them in single or double quotes, or by writing a backslash
before them. Eg to match an account name containing a space:

``` shell
$ hledger register 'credit card'
```

or:

``` shell
$ hledger register credit\ card
```

Windows users should keep in mind that `cmd` treats single quote as a
regular character, so you should be using double quotes exclusively.
PowerShell treats both single and double quotes as quotes.

#### Double escaping (regular expression metacharacters)

Characters significant in [regular expressions](#regular-expressions)
(described below) - such as `.`, `^`, `$`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `|`, and
`\` - may need to be \"regex-escaped\" if you don\'t want them to be
interpreted by hledger\'s regular expression engine. This is done by
writing backslashes before them, but since backslash is typically also a
shell metacharacter, both shell-escaping and regex-escaping will be
needed. Eg to match a literal `$` sign while using the bash shell:

``` shell
$ hledger balance cur:'\$'
```

or:

``` shell
$ hledger balance cur:\\$
```

#### Triple escaping (for add-on commands)

When you use hledger to run an external add-on command (described
below), one level of shell-escaping is lost from any options or
arguments intended for by the add-on command, so those need an extra
level of shell-escaping. Eg to match a literal `$` sign while using the
bash shell and running an add-on command (`ui`):

``` shell
$ hledger ui cur:'\\$'
```

or:

``` shell
$ hledger ui cur:\\\\$
```

If you wondered why *four* backslashes, perhaps this helps:

|                 |         |
|-----------------|---------|
| unescaped:      | `$`     |
| escaped:        | `\$`    |
| double-escaped: | `\\$`   |
| triple-escaped: | `\\\\$` |

Or, you can avoid the extra escaping by running the add-on executable
directly:

``` shell
$ hledger-ui cur:\\$
```

#### Less escaping

Options and arguments are sometimes used in places other than the shell
command line, where shell-escaping is not needed, so there you should
use one less level of escaping. Those places include:

-   an @argumentfile
-   hledger-ui\'s filter field
-   hledger-web\'s search form
-   GHCI\'s prompt (used by developers).

### Unicode characters

hledger is expected to handle non-ascii characters correctly:

-   they should be parsed correctly in input files and on the command
    line, by all hledger tools (add, iadd, hledger-web\'s
    search/add/edit forms, etc.)

-   they should be displayed correctly by all hledger tools, and
    on-screen alignment should be preserved.

This requires a well-configured environment. Here are some tips:

-   A system locale must be configured, and it must be one that can
    decode the characters being used. In bash, you can set a locale like
    this: `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`. There are some more details in
    [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting). This step is essential -
    without it, hledger will quit on encountering a non-ascii character
    (as with all GHC-compiled programs).

-   your terminal software (eg Terminal.app, iTerm, CMD.exe, xterm..)
    must support unicode

-   the terminal must be using a font which includes the required
    unicode glyphs

-   the terminal should be configured to display wide characters as
    double width (for report alignment)

-   on Windows, for best results you should run hledger in the same kind
    of environment in which it was built. Eg hledger built in the
    standard CMD.EXE environment (like the binaries on our download
    page) might show display problems when run in a cygwin or msys
    terminal, and vice versa. (See eg
    [#961](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/961#issuecomment-471229644)).

### Regular expressions

hledger uses [regular expressions](http://www.regular-expressions.info)
in a number of places:

-   [query terms](#queries), on the command line and in the hledger-web
    search form: `REGEX`, `desc:REGEX`, `cur:REGEX`, `tag:...=REGEX`
-   [CSV rules](#csv-rules) conditional blocks: `if REGEX ...`
-   [account alias directive](#alias-directive) and `--alias` option:
    `alias /REGEX/ = REPLACEMENT`, `--alias /REGEX/=REPLACEMENT`

hledger\'s regular expressions come from the
[regex-tdfa](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/regex-tdfa/docs/Text-Regex-TDFA.html)
library. If they\'re not doing what you expect, it\'s important to know
exactly what they support:

1.  they are case insensitive
2.  they are infix matching (they do not need to match the entire thing
    being matched)
3.  they are [POSIX
    ERE](http://www.regular-expressions.info/posix.html#ere) (extended
    regular expressions)
4.  they also support [GNU word
    boundaries](http://www.regular-expressions.info/wordboundaries.html)
    (`\b`, `\B`, `\<`, `\>`)
5.  they do not support
    [backreferences](https://www.regular-expressions.info/backref.html);
    if you write `\1`, it will match the digit `1`. Except when doing
    text replacement, eg in [account aliases](#regex-aliases), where
    [backreferences](https://www.regular-expressions.info/backref.html)
    can be used in the replacement string to reference [capturing
    groups](http://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html) in the
    search regexp.
6.  they do not support [mode
    modifiers](http://www.regular-expressions.info/modifiers.html)
    (`(?s)`), character classes (`\w`, `\d`), or anything else not
    mentioned above.

Some things to note:

-   In the `alias` directive and `--alias` option, regular expressions
    must be enclosed in forward slashes (`/REGEX/`). Elsewhere in
    hledger, these are not required.

-   In queries, to match a regular expression metacharacter like `$` as
    a literal character, prepend a backslash. Eg to search for amounts
    with the dollar sign in hledger-web, write `cur:\$`.

-   On the command line, some metacharacters like `$` have a special
    meaning to the shell and so must be escaped at least once more. See
    [Special characters](#special-characters).

### Argument files

You can save a set of command line options and arguments in a file, and
then reuse them by writing `@FILENAME` as a command line argument. Eg:
`hledger bal @foo.args`.

Inside the argument file, each line should contain just one option or
argument. Don\'t use spaces except inside quotes (or you\'ll see a
confusing error); write `=` (or nothing) between a flag and its
argument. For the special characters mentioned above, use one less level
of quoting than you would at the command prompt.

## Output

### Output destination

hledger commands send their output to the terminal by default. You can
of course redirect this, eg into a file, using standard shell syntax:

``` shell
$ hledger print > foo.txt
```

Some commands (print, register, stats, the balance commands) also
provide the `-o/--output-file` option, which does the same thing without
needing the shell. Eg:

``` shell
$ hledger print -o foo.txt
$ hledger print -o -        # write to stdout (the default)
```

### Output format

Some commands offer other kinds of output, not just text on the
terminal. Here are those commands and the formats currently supported:

| \-                 | txt              | csv              | html               | json | sql |
|--------------------------|----------|----------|------------|---------|--------|
| aregister          | Y                | Y                | Y                  | Y    |     |
| balance            | Y *<sup>1</sup>* | Y *<sup>1</sup>* | Y *<sup>1,2</sup>* | Y    |     |
| balancesheet       | Y *<sup>1</sup>* | Y *<sup>1</sup>* | Y *<sup>1</sup>*   | Y    |     |
| balancesheetequity | Y *<sup>1</sup>* | Y *<sup>1</sup>* | Y *<sup>1</sup>*   | Y    |     |
| cashflow           | Y *<sup>1</sup>* | Y *<sup>1</sup>* | Y *<sup>1</sup>*   | Y    |     |
| incomestatement    | Y *<sup>1</sup>* | Y *<sup>1</sup>* | Y *<sup>1</sup>*   | Y    |     |
| print              | Y                | Y                |                    | Y    | Y   |
| register           | Y                | Y                |                    | Y    |     |

-   *<sup>1</sup> Also affected by the balance commands\' [`--layout`
    option](#commodity-layout).*
-   *<sup>2</sup> `balance` does not support html output without a
    report interval or with `--budget`.*

The output format is selected by the `-O/--output-format=FMT` option:

``` shell
$ hledger print -O csv    # print CSV on stdout
```

or by the filename extension of an output file specified with the
`-o/--output-file=FILE.FMT` option:

``` shell
$ hledger balancesheet -o foo.csv    # write CSV to foo.csv
```

The `-O` option can be combined with `-o` to override the file
extension, if needed:

``` shell
$ hledger balancesheet -o foo.txt -O csv    # write CSV to foo.txt
```

Some notes about the various output formats:

#### CSV output

-   In CSV output, [digit group marks](#decimal-marks-digit-group-marks)
    (such as thousands separators) are disabled automatically.

#### HTML output

-   HTML output can be styled by an optional `hledger.css` file in the
    same directory.

#### JSON output

-   This is not yet much used; real-world feedback is welcome.

-   Our JSON is rather large and verbose, since it is a faithful
    representation of hledger\'s internal data types. To understand the
    JSON, read the Haskell type definitions, which are mostly in
    <https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/blob/master/hledger-lib/Hledger/Data/Types.hs>.

<!-- -->

-   hledger represents quantities as Decimal values storing up to 255
    significant digits, eg for repeating decimals. Such numbers can
    arise in practice (from automatically-calculated transaction
    prices), and would break most JSON consumers. So in JSON, we show
    quantities as simple Numbers with at most 10 decimal places. We
    don\'t limit the number of integer digits, but that part is under
    your control. We hope this approach will not cause problems in
    practice; if you find otherwise, please let us know. (Cf
    [#1195](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1195))

#### SQL output

-   This is not yet much used; real-world feedback is welcome.

-   SQL output is expected to work at least with SQLite, MySQL and
    Postgres.

-   For SQLite, it will be more useful if you modify the generated `id`
    field to be a PRIMARY KEY. Eg:

        $ hledger print -O sql | sed 's/id serial/id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL/g' | ...

-   SQL output is structured with the expectations that statements will
    be executed in the empty database. If you already have tables
    created via SQL output of hledger, you would probably want to either
    clear tables of existing data (via `delete` or `truncate` SQL
    statements) or drop tables completely as otherwise your postings
    will be duped.

### Commodity styles

When displaying amounts, hledger infers a standard display style for
each commodity/currency, as described below in [Commodity display
style](#commodity-display-style).

If needed, this can be overridden by a `-c/--commodity-style` option
(except for [cost amounts](#costs) and amounts displayed by the
[`print`](#print) command, which are always displayed with all decimal
digits). For example, the following will force dollar amounts to be
displayed as shown:

``` shell
$ hledger print -c '$1.000,0'
```

This option can repeated to set the display style for multiple
commodities/currencies. Its argument is as described in the [commodity
directive](#commodity-directive).

### Colour

In terminal output, some commands can produce colour when the terminal
supports it:

-   if the `--color/--colour` option is given a value of `yes` or
    `always` (or `no` or `never`), colour will (or will not) be used;
-   otherwise, if the `NO_COLOR` environment variable is set, colour
    will not be used;
-   otherwise, colour will be used if the output (terminal or file)
    supports it.

### Box-drawing

In terminal output, you can enable unicode box-drawing characters to
render prettier tables:

-   if the `--pretty` option is given a value of `yes` or `always` (or
    `no` or `never`), unicode characters will (or will not) be used;
-   otherwise, unicode characters will not be used.

### Paging

When showing long output in the terminal, hledger will try to use the
pager specified by the `PAGER` environment variable, or `less`, or
`more`. (A pager is a helper program that shows one page at a time
rather than scrolling everything off screen). Currently it does this
only for help output, not for reports; specifically,

-   when listing commands, with `hledger`
-   when showing help with `hledger [CMD] --help`,
-   when viewing manuals with `hledger help` or `hledger --man`.

Note the pager is expected to handle ANSI codes, which hledger uses eg
for bold emphasis. For the common pager `less` (and its `more`
compatibility mode), we add `R` to the `LESS` and `MORE` environment
variables to make this work. If you use a different pager, you might
need to configure it similarly, to avoid seeing junk on screen (let us
know). Otherwise, you can set the `NO_COLOR` environment variable to 1
to disable all ANSI output (see [Colour](#colour)).

### Debug output

We intend hledger to be relatively easy to troubleshoot, introspect and
develop. You can add `--debug[=N]` to any hledger command line to see
additional debug output. N ranges from 1 (least output, the default) to
9 (maximum output). Typically you would start with 1 and increase until
you are seeing enough. Debug output goes to stderr, and is not affected
by `-o/--output-file` (unless you redirect stderr to stdout, eg:
`2>&1`). It will be interleaved with normal output, which can help
reveal when parts of the code are evaluated. To capture debug output in
a log file instead, you can usually redirect stderr, eg:

``` shell
hledger bal --debug=3 2>hledger.log
```

## Environment

These environment variables affect hledger:

**COLUMNS** This is normally set by your terminal; some hledger commands
(`register`) will format their output to this width. If not set, they
will try to use the available terminal width.

**LEDGER_FILE** The main journal file to use when not specified with
`-f/--file`. Default: `$HOME/.hledger.journal`.

**NO_COLOR** If this environment variable is set (with any value),
hledger will not use ANSI color codes in terminal output, unless
overridden by an explicit `--color/--colour` option.

## PART 2: DATA FORMATS

## Journal

hledger\'s default file format, representing a General Journal. Here\'s
a cheatsheet/mini-tutorial, or you can skip ahead to [About journal

# Here is the main syntax of hledger's journal format
# (omitting extra Ledger compatibility syntax).
# hledger journals contain comments, directives, and transactions, in any order:

### About journal format

hledger\'s usual data source is a plain text file containing journal
entries in hledger journal format. This file represents a standard
accounting [general
journal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_journal). I use file names
ending in `.journal`, but that\'s not required. The journal file
contains a number of transaction entries, each describing a transfer of
money (or any commodity) between two or more named accounts, in a simple
format readable by both hledger and humans.

hledger\'s journal format is compatible with most of [Ledger\'s journal
format](http://ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Journal-Format), but
not all of it. The differences and interoperation tips are described at
[hledger and Ledger](ledger.html). With some care, and by avoiding
incompatible features, you can keep your hledger journal readable by
Ledger and vice versa. This can useful eg for comparing the behaviour of
one app against the other.

You can use hledger without learning any more about this file; just use
the [add](#add) or [web](#web) or [import](#import) commands to create
and update it.

Many users, though, edit the journal file with a text editor, and track
changes with a version control system such as git. Editor addons such as
ledger-mode or hledger-mode for Emacs, vim-ledger for Vim, and
hledger-vscode for Visual Studio Code, make this easier, adding colour,
formatting, tab completion, and useful commands. See [Editor
configuration](/editors.html) at hledger.org for the full list.

Here\'s a description of each part of the file format (and hledger\'s
data model).

A hledger journal file can contain three kinds of thing: file comments,
transactions, and/or directives (counting periodic transaction rules and
auto posting rules as directives).

### Comments

Lines in the journal will be ignored if they begin with a hash (`#`) or
a semicolon (`;`). (See also [Other syntax](#other-syntax).) hledger
will also ignore regions beginning with a `comment` line and ending with
an `end comment` line (or file end). Here\'s a suggestion for choosing
between them:

-   `#` for top-level notes
-   `;` for commenting out things temporarily
-   `comment` for quickly commenting large regions (remember it\'s
    there, or you might get confused)

Eg:

``` journal
# a comment line
; another commentline
comment
A multi-line comment block,
continuing until "end comment" directive
or the end of the current file.
end comment
```

Some hledger entries can have same-line comments attached to them, from
; (semicolon) to end of line. See Transaction comments, Posting
comments, and Account comments below.

### Transactions

Transactions are the main unit of information in a journal file. They
represent events, typically a movement of some quantity of commodities
between two or more named accounts.

Each transaction is recorded as a journal entry, beginning with a
[simple date](#simple-dates) in column 0. This can be followed by any of
the following optional fields, separated by spaces:

-   a [status](#status) character (empty, `!`, or `*`)
-   a code (any short number or text, enclosed in parentheses)
-   a description (any remaining text until end of line or a semicolon)
-   a comment (any remaining text following a semicolon until end of
    line, and any following indented lines beginning with a semicolon)
-   0 or more indented [*posting* lines](#postings), describing what was
    transferred and the accounts involved (indented comment lines are
    also allowed, but not blank lines or non-indented lines).

Here\'s a simple journal file containing one transaction:

``` journal
2008/01/01 income
  assets:bank:checking   $1
  income:salary         $-1
```

### Dates

#### Simple dates

Dates in the journal file use *simple dates* format: `YYYY-MM-DD` or
`YYYY/MM/DD` or `YYYY.MM.DD`, with leading zeros optional. The year may
be omitted, in which case it will be inferred from the context: the
current transaction, the default year set with a [`Y`
directive](#y-directive), or the current date when the command is run.
Some examples: `2010-01-31`, `2010/01/31`, `2010.1.31`, `1/31`.

(The UI also accepts simple dates, as well as the more flexible [smart
dates](#smart-dates) documented in the hledger manual.)

#### Posting dates

You can give individual postings a different date from their parent
transaction, by adding a [posting comment](#posting-comment) containing
a [tag](#tags) (see below) like `date:DATE`. This is probably the best
way to control posting dates precisely. Eg in this example the expense
should appear in May reports, and the deduction from checking should be
reported on 6/1 for easy bank reconciliation:

``` journal
2015/5/30
    expenses:food     $10  ; food purchased on saturday 5/30
    assets:checking        ; bank cleared it on monday, date:6/1
```

``` shell
$ hledger -f t.j register food
2015-05-30                      expenses:food                  $10           $10
```

``` shell
$ hledger -f t.j register checking
2015-06-01                      assets:checking               $-10          $-10
```

DATE should be a [simple date](#simple-dates); if the year is not
specified it will use the year of the transaction\'s date.\
The `date:` tag must have a valid simple date value if it is present, eg
a `date:` tag with no value is not allowed.

### Status

Transactions, or individual postings within a transaction, can have a
status mark, which is a single character before the transaction
description or posting account name, separated from it by a space,
indicating one of three statuses:

| mark   | status   |
|--------|----------|
|        | unmarked |
| `!`    | pending  |
| `*`    | cleared  |

When reporting, you can filter by status with the `-U/--unmarked`,
`-P/--pending`, and `-C/--cleared` flags; or the `status:`, `status:!`,
and `status:*` [queries](#queries); or the U, P, C keys in hledger-ui.

Note, in Ledger and in older versions of hledger, the \"unmarked\" state
is called \"uncleared\". As of hledger 1.3 we have renamed it to
unmarked for clarity.

To replicate Ledger and old hledger\'s behaviour of also matching
pending, combine -U and -P.

Status marks are optional, but can be helpful eg for reconciling with
real-world accounts. Some editor modes provide highlighting and
shortcuts for working with status. Eg in Emacs ledger-mode, you can
toggle transaction status with C-c C-e, or posting status with C-c C-c.

What \"uncleared\", \"pending\", and \"cleared\" actually mean is up to
you. Here\'s one suggestion:

| status    | meaning                                                            |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| uncleared | recorded but not yet reconciled; needs review                      |
| pending   | tentatively reconciled (if needed, eg during a big reconciliation) |
| cleared   | complete, reconciled as far as possible, and considered correct    |

With this scheme, you would use `-PC` to see the current balance at your
bank, `-U` to see things which will probably hit your bank soon (like
uncashed checks), and no flags to see the most up-to-date state of your
finances.

### Code

After the status mark, but before the description, you can optionally
write a transaction \"code\", enclosed in parentheses. This is a good
place to record a check number, or some other important transaction id
or reference number.

### Description

A transaction\'s description is the rest of the line following the date
and status mark (or until a comment begins). Sometimes called the
\"narration\" in traditional bookkeeping, it can be used for whatever
you wish, or left blank. Transaction descriptions can be queried, unlike
[comments](#transaction-comments).

#### Payee and note

You can optionally include a `|` (pipe) character in descriptions to
subdivide the description into separate fields for payee/payer name on
the left (up to the first `|`) and an additional note field on the right
(after the first `|`). This may be worthwhile if you need to do more
precise [querying](#queries) and [pivoting](#pivoting) by payee or by
note.

### Transaction comments

Text following `;`, after a transaction description, and/or on indented
lines immediately below it, form comments for that transaction. They are
reproduced by `print` but otherwise ignored, except they may contain
[tags](#tags), which are not ignored.

``` journal
2012-01-01 something  ; a transaction comment
    ; a second line of transaction comment
    expenses   1
    assets
```

### Postings

A posting is an addition of some amount to, or removal of some amount
from, an account. Each posting line begins with at least one space or
tab (2 or 4 spaces is common), followed by:

-   (optional) a [status](#status) character (empty, `!`, or `*`),
    followed by a space
-   (required) an [account name](#account-names) (any text, optionally
    containing **single spaces**, until end of line or a double space)
-   (optional) **two or more spaces** or tabs followed by an
    [amount](#amounts).

Positive amounts are being added to the account, negative amounts are
being removed.

The amounts within a transaction must always sum up to zero. As a
convenience, one amount may be left blank; it will be inferred so as to
balance the transaction.

Be sure to note the unusual two-space delimiter between account name and
amount. This makes it easy to write account names containing spaces. But
if you accidentally leave only one space (or tab) before the amount, the
amount will be considered part of the account name.

### Account names

Accounts are the main way of categorising things in hledger. As in
Double Entry Bookkeeping, they can represent real world accounts (such
as a bank account), or more abstract categories such as \"money borrowed
from Frank\" or \"money spent on electricity\".

You can use any account names you like, but we usually start with the
traditional accounting categories, which in english are `assets`,
`liabilities`, `equity`, `revenues`, `expenses`. (You might see these
referred to as A, L, E, R, X for short.)

For more precise reporting, we usually divide the top level accounts
into more detailed subaccounts, by writing a full colon between account
name parts. For example, from the account names `assets:bank:checking`
and `expenses:food`, hledger will infer this hierarchy of five accounts:

    assets
    assets:bank
    assets:bank:checking
    expenses
    expenses:food

Shown as an outline, the hierarchical tree structure is more clear:

    assets
     bank
      checking
    expenses
     food

hledger reports can summarise the account tree to any depth, so you can
go as deep as you like with subcategories, but keeping your account
names relatively simple may be best when starting out.

Account names may be capitalised or not; they may contain letters,
numbers, symbols, or single spaces. Note, when an account name and an
amount are written on the same line, they must be separated by **two or
more spaces** (or tabs).

Parentheses or brackets enclosing the full account name indicate
[virtual postings](#virtual-postings), described below. Parentheses or
brackets internal to the account name have no special meaning.

Account names can be altered temporarily or permanently by [account
aliases](#alias-directive).

### Amounts

After the account name, there is usually an amount. (Important: between
account name and amount, there must be **two or more spaces**.)

hledger\'s amount format is flexible, supporting several international
formats. Here are some examples. Amounts have a number (the
\"quantity\"):

    1

..and usually a currency symbol or commodity name (more on this below),
to the left or right of the quantity, with or without a separating
space:

    $1
    4000 AAPL
    3 "green apples"

Amounts can be preceded by a minus sign (or a plus sign, though plus is
the default), The sign can be written before or after a left-side
commodity symbol:

    -$1
    $-1

One or more spaces between the sign and the number are acceptable when
parsing (but they won\'t be displayed in output):

    + $1
    $-      1

Scientific E notation is allowed:

    1E-6
    EUR 1E3

#### Decimal marks, digit group marks

A *decimal mark* can be written as a period or a comma:

    1.23
    1,23456780000009

In the integer part of the quantity (left of the decimal mark), groups
of digits can optionally be separated by a *digit group mark* - a space,
comma, or period (different from the decimal mark):

         $1,000,000.00
      EUR 2.000.000,00
    INR 9,99,99,999.00
          1 000 000.9455

Note, a number containing a single digit group mark and no decimal mark
is ambiguous. Are these digit group marks or decimal marks ?

    1,000
    1.000

If you don\'t tell it otherwise, hledger will assume both of the above
are decimal marks, parsing both numbers as 1.

To prevent confusing parsing mistakes and undetected typos, especially
if your data contains digit group marks (eg, thousands separators), we
recommend explicitly declaring the decimal mark character in each
journal file, using a directive at the top of the file. The
[`decimal-mark`](#decimal-mark) directive is best, otherwise
[`commodity`](#commodity-directive) directives will also work. These are
described below.

#### Commodity

Amounts in hledger have both a \"quantity\", which is a signed decimal
number, and a \"commodity\", which is a currency symbol, stock ticker,
or any word or phrase describing something you are tracking.

If the commodity name contains non-letters (spaces, numbers, or
punctuation), you must always write it inside double quotes
(`"green apples"`, `"ABC123"`).

If you write just a bare number, that too will have a commodity, with
name `""`; we call that the \"no-symbol commodity\".

Actually, hledger combines these single-commodity amounts into more
powerful multi-commodity amounts, which are what it works with most of
the time. A multi-commodity amount could be, eg:
`1 USD, 2 EUR, 3.456 TSLA`. In practice, you will only see
multi-commodity amounts in hledger\'s output; you can\'t write them
directly in the journal file.

(If you are writing scripts or working with hledger\'s internals, these
are the `Amount` and `MixedAmount` types.)

#### Directives influencing number parsing and display

You can add `decimal-mark` and `commodity` directives to the journal, to
declare and control these things more explicitly and precisely. These
are described below, but here\'s a quick example:

``` journal
# the decimal mark character used by all amounts in this file (all commodities)
decimal-mark .

# display styles for the $, EUR, INR and no-symbol commodities:
commodity $1,000.00
commodity EUR 1.000,00
commodity INR 9,99,99,999.00
commodity 1 000 000.9455
```

<a name="amount-display-style"></a>

#### Commodity display style

For the amounts in each commodity, hledger chooses a consistent display
style to use in most reports. (Exceptions: [price amounts](#costs), and
all amounts displayed by the [`print`](#print) command, are displayed
with all of their decimal digits visible.)

A commodity\'s display style is inferred as follows.

First, if a [default commodity](#default-commodity) is declared with
`D`, this commodity and its style is applied to any no-symbol amounts in
the journal.

Then each commodity\'s style is inferred from one of the following, in
order of preference:

-   The [commodity directive](#commodity-directive) for that commodity
    (including the no-symbol commodity), if any.
-   The amounts in that commodity seen in the journal\'s transactions.
    (Posting amounts only; prices and periodic or auto rules are
    ignored, currently.)
-   The built-in fallback style, which looks like this: `$1000.00`.
    (Symbol on the left, period decimal mark, two decimal places.)

A style is inferred from journal amounts as follows:

-   Use the general style (decimal mark, symbol placement) of the first
    amount
-   Use the first-seen digit group style (digit group mark, digit group
    sizes), if any
-   Use the maximum number of decimal places of all.

Cost amounts don\'t affect the commodity display style directly, but
occasionally they can do so indirectly (eg when a posting\'s amount is
inferred using a cost). If you find this causing problems, use a
commodity directive to fix the display style.

To summarise: each commodity\'s amounts will be normalised to (a) the
style declared by a `commodity` directive, or (b) the style of the first
posting amount in the journal, with the first-seen digit group style and
the maximum-seen number of decimal places. So if your reports are
showing amounts in a way you don\'t like, eg with too many decimal
places, use a commodity directive. Some examples:

``` journal
# declare euro, dollar, bitcoin and no-symbol commodities and set their 
# input number formats and output display styles:
commodity EUR 1.000,
commodity $1000.00
commodity 1000.00000000 BTC
commodity 1 000.
```

The inferred commodity style can be [overridden](#commodity-styles) by
supplying a command line option.

#### Rounding

Amounts are stored internally as decimal numbers with up to 255 decimal
places, and displayed with the number of decimal places specified by the
commodity display style. Note, hledger uses [banker\'s
rounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankers_rounding): it rounds to
the nearest even number, eg 0.5 displayed with zero decimal places is
\"0\").

<a name="transaction-prices"></a>

### Costs

After a posting amount, you can note its cost (when buying) or selling
price (when selling) in another commodity, by writing either
`@ UNITPRICE` or `@@ TOTALPRICE` after it. This indicates a conversion
transaction, where one commodity is exchanged for another.

(You might also see this called \"transaction price\" in hledger docs,
discussions, or code; that term was directionally neutral and reminded
that it is a price specific to a transaction, but we now just call it
\"cost\", with the understanding that the transaction could be a
purchase or a sale.)

Costs are usually written explicitly with `@` or `@@`, but can also be
inferred automatically for simple multi-commodity transactions. Note, if
costs are inferred, the order of postings is significant; the first
posting will have a cost attached, in the commodity of the second.

As an example, here are several ways to record purchases of a foreign
currency in hledger, using the cost notation either explicitly or
implicitly:

1.  Write the price per unit, as `@ UNITPRICE` after the amount:

    ``` journal
    2009/1/1
      assets:euros     €100 @ $1.35  ; one hundred euros purchased at $1.35 each
      assets:dollars                 ; balancing amount is -$135.00
    ```

2.  Write the total price, as `@@ TOTALPRICE` after the amount:

    ``` journal
    2009/1/1
      assets:euros     €100 @@ $135  ; one hundred euros purchased at $135 for the lot
      assets:dollars
    ```

3.  Specify amounts for all postings, using exactly two commodities, and
    let hledger infer the price that balances the transaction. Note the
    effect of posting order: the price is added to first posting, making
    it `€100 @@ $135`, as in example 2:

    ``` journal
    2009/1/1
      assets:euros     €100          ; one hundred euros purchased
      assets:dollars  $-135          ; for $135
    ```

Amounts can be converted to cost at report time using the
[`-B/--cost`](#reporting-options) flag; this is discussed more in the
˜[COST REPORTING](#cost-reporting) section.

Note that the cost normally should be a positive amount, though it\'s
not required to be. This can be a little confusing, see discussion at
[\--infer-market-prices: market prices from
transactions](#--infer-market-prices-market-prices-from-transactions).

#### Other cost/lot notations

A slight digression for Ledger and Beancount users. Ledger has a number
of cost/lot-related notations:

-   `@ UNITCOST` and `@@ TOTALCOST`
    -   expresses a conversion rate, as in hledger
    -   when buying, also creates a lot than can be selected at selling
        time
-   `(@) UNITCOST` and `(@@) TOTALCOST` ([virtual
    cost](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Virtual-posting-costs))
    -   like the above, but also means \"this cost was exceptional,
        don\'t use it when inferring market prices\".

Currently, hledger treats the above like `@` and `@@`; the parentheses
are ignored.

-   `{=FIXEDUNITCOST}` and `{{=FIXEDTOTALCOST}}` ([fixed
    price](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Fixing-Lot-Prices))
    -   when buying, means \"this cost is also the fixed price, don\'t
        let it fluctuate in value reports\"
-   `{UNITCOST}` and `{{TOTALCOST}}` ([lot
    price](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Buying-and-Selling-Stock))
    -   can be used identically to `@ UNITCOST` and `@@ TOTALCOST`, also
        creates a lot
    -   when selling, combined with `@ ...`, specifies an investment lot
        by its cost basis; does not check if that lot is present
-   and related: `[YYYY/MM/DD]` ([lot
    date](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Lot-dates))
    -   when buying, attaches this acquisition date to the lot
    -   when selling, selects a lot by its acquisition date
-   `(SOME TEXT)` ([lot
    note](https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Lot-notes))
    -   when buying, attaches this note to the lot
    -   when selling, selects a lot by its note

Currently, hledger accepts any or all of the above in any order after
the posting amount, but ignores them. (This can break transaction
balancing.)

For Beancount users, the
[notation](https://beancount.github.io/docs/beancount_language_syntax.html#costs-and-prices)
and
[behaviour](https://beancount.github.io/docs/how_inventories_work.html)
is different:

-   `@ UNITCOST` and `@@ TOTALCOST`
    -   expresses a cost without creating a lot, as in hledger
    -   when buying (augmenting) or selling (reducing) a lot, combined
        with `{...}`: documents the cost/selling price (not used for
        transaction balancing)
-   `{UNITCOST}` and `{{TOTALCOST}}`
    -   when buying (augmenting), expresses the cost for transaction
        balancing, and also creates a lot with this cost basis attached
    -   when selling (reducing),
        -   selects a lot by its cost basis
        -   raises an error if that lot is not present or can not be
            selected unambiguously (depending on booking method
            configured)
        -   expresses the selling price for transaction balancing

Currently, hledger accepts the `{UNITCOST}`/`{{TOTALCOST}}` notation but
ignores it.

-   variations: `{}`, `{YYYY-MM-DD}`, `{"LABEL"}`,
    `{UNITCOST, "LABEL"}`, `{UNITCOST, YYYY-MM-DD, "LABEL"}` etc.

Currently, hledger rejects these.

### Balance assertions

hledger supports [Ledger-style balance
assertions](http://ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Balance-assertions)
in journal files. These look like, for example, `= EXPECTEDBALANCE`
following a posting\'s amount. Eg here we assert the expected dollar
balance in accounts a and b after each posting:

``` journal
2013/1/1
  a   $1  =$1
  b       =$-1

2013/1/2
  a   $1  =$2
  b  $-1  =$-2
```

After reading a journal file, hledger will check all balance assertions
and report an error if any of them fail. Balance assertions can protect
you from, eg, inadvertently disrupting reconciled balances while
cleaning up old entries. You can disable them temporarily with the
`-I/--ignore-assertions` flag, which can be useful for troubleshooting
or for reading Ledger files. (Note: this flag currently does not disable
balance assignments, described below).

#### Assertions and ordering

hledger sorts an account\'s postings and assertions first by date and
then (for postings on the same day) by parse order. Note this is
different from Ledger, which sorts assertions only by parse order.
(Also, Ledger assertions do not see the accumulated effect of repeated
postings to the same account within a transaction.)

So, hledger balance assertions keep working if you reorder
differently-dated transactions within the journal. But if you reorder
same-dated transactions or postings, assertions might break and require
updating. This order dependence does bring an advantage: precise control
over the order of postings and assertions within a day, so you can
assert intra-day balances.

#### Assertions and multiple included files

Multiple files included with the [`include` directive](#include-directive)
are processed as if concatenated into one file, preserving their order
and the posting order within each file. It means that balance assertions
in later files will see balance from earlier files.

And if you have multiple postings to an account on the same day, split
across multiple files, and you want to assert the account\'s balance on
that day, you\'ll need to put the assertion in the right file - the last
one in the sequence, probably.

#### Assertions and multiple -f files

Unlike `include`, when multiple files are specified on the command line
with multiple `-f/--file` options, balance assertions will not see
balance from earlier files. This can be useful when you do not want
problems in earlier files to disrupt valid assertions in later files.

If you do want assertions to see balance from earlier files, use
`include`, or concatenate the files temporarily.

#### Assertions and commodities

The asserted balance must be a simple single-commodity amount, and in
fact the assertion checks only this commodity\'s balance within the
(possibly multi-commodity) account balance. This is how assertions work
in Ledger also. We could call this a \"partial\" balance assertion.

To assert the balance of more than one commodity in an account, you can
write multiple postings, each asserting one commodity\'s balance.

You can make a stronger \"total\" balance assertion by writing a double
equals sign (`== EXPECTEDBALANCE`). This asserts that there are no other
commodities in the account besides the asserted one (or at least, that
their balance is 0).

``` journal
2013/1/1
  a   $1
  a    1€
  b  $-1
  c   -1€

2013/1/2  ; These assertions succeed
  a    0  =  $1
  a    0  =   1€
  b    0 == $-1
  c    0 ==  -1€

2013/1/3  ; This assertion fails as 'a' also contains 1€
  a    0 ==  $1
```

It\'s not yet possible to make a complete assertion about a balance that
has multiple commodities. One workaround is to isolate each commodity
into its own subaccount:

``` journal
2013/1/1
  a:usd   $1
  a:euro   1€
  b

2013/1/2
  a        0 ==  0
  a:usd    0 == $1
  a:euro   0 ==  1€
```

#### Assertions and prices

Balance assertions ignore [costs](#costs), and should normally be
written without one:

``` journal
2019/1/1
  (a)     $1 @ €1 = $1
```

We do allow prices to be written there, however, and [print](#print)
shows them, even though they don\'t affect whether the assertion passes
or fails. This is for backward compatibility (hledger\'s [close](#close)
command used to generate balance assertions with prices), and because
[balance *assignments*](#balance-assignments) do use them (see below).

#### Assertions and subaccounts

The balance assertions above (`=` and `==`) do not count the balance
from subaccounts; they check the account\'s exclusive balance only. You
can assert the balance including subaccounts by writing `=*` or `==*`,
eg:

``` journal
2019/1/1
  equity:opening balances
  checking:a       5
  checking:b       5
  checking         1  ==* 11
```

#### Assertions and virtual postings

Balance assertions always consider both real and
[virtual](#virtual-postings) postings; they are not affected by the
`--real/-R` flag or `real:` query.

#### Assertions and auto postings

Balance assertions *are* affected by the `--auto` flag, which generates
[auto postings](#auto-postings), which can alter account balances.
Because auto postings are optional in hledger, accounts affected by them
effectively have two balances. But balance assertions can only test one
or the other of these. So to avoid making fragile assertions, either:

-   assert the balance calculated with `--auto`, and always use `--auto`
    with that file
-   or assert the balance calculated without `--auto`, and never use
    `--auto` with that file
-   or avoid balance assertions on accounts affected by auto postings
    (or avoid auto postings entirely).

#### Assertions and precision

Balance assertions compare the exactly calculated amounts, which are not
always what is shown by reports. Eg a [commodity
directive](#commodity-directive) may limit the display precision, but
this will not affect balance assertions. Balance assertion failure
messages show exact amounts.

### Posting comments

Text following `;`, at the end of a posting line, and/or on indented
lines immediately below it, form comments for that posting. They are
reproduced by `print` but otherwise ignored, except they may contain
[tags](#tags), which are not ignored.

``` journal
2012-01-01
    expenses   1  ; a comment for posting 1
    assets
    ; a comment for posting 2
    ; a second comment line for posting 2
```

### Tags

Tags are a way to add extra labels or labelled data to transactions,
postings, or accounts, which you can then [search](#queries) or
[pivot](#pivoting) on.

They are written as a word (optionally hyphenated) immediately followed
by a full colon, in a transaction or posting or account directive\'s
[comment](#account-comments). (This is an exception to the usual rule
that things in comments are ignored.) Eg, here four different tags are
recorded: one on the checking account, two on the transaction, and one
on the expenses posting:

``` journal
account assets:checking         ; accounttag:

2017/1/16 bought groceries      ; transactiontag-1:
    ; transactiontag-2:
    assets:checking        $-1
    expenses:food           $1  ; postingtag:
```

Postings also inherit tags from their transaction and their account. And
transactions also acquire tags from their postings (and postings\'
accounts). So in the example above, the expenses posting effectively has
all four tags (by inheriting from account and transaction), and the
transaction also has all four tags (by acquiring from the expenses
posting).

You can list tag names with `hledger tags [NAMEREGEX]`, or match by tag
name with a `tag:NAMEREGEX` query.

#### Tag values

Tags can have a value, which is any text after the colon up until a
comma or end of line (with surrounding whitespace removed). Note this
means that hledger tag values can not contain commas. Eg in the
following posting, the three tags\' values are \"value 1\", \"value 2\",
and \"\" (empty) respectively:

``` journal
    expenses:food   $10    ; foo, tag1: value 1 , tag2:value 2, bar tag3: , baz
```

Note that tags can be repeated, and are additive rather than overriding:
when the same tag name is seen again with a new value, the new
name:value pair is added to the tags. (It is not possible to override a
tag\'s value or remove a tag.)

You can list a tag\'s values with `hledger tags TAGNAME --values`, or
match by tag value with a `tag:NAMEREGEX=VALUEREGEX` query.

### Directives

Besides transactions, there is something else you can put in a `journal`
file: directives. These are declarations, beginning with a keyword, that
modify hledger\'s behaviour. Some directives can have more specific
subdirectives, indented below them. hledger\'s directives are similar to
Ledger\'s in many cases, but there are also many
[differences](ledger.md). Directives are not required, but can be
useful. Here are the main directives:

| purpose                                                        | directive                                                                                                                  |

#### Directives and multiple files

Directives vary in their scope, ie which journal entries and which input
files they affect. Most often, a directive will affect the following
entries and included files if any, until the end of the current file -
and no further. You might find this inconvenient! For example, `alias`
directives [do not affect parent or sibling
files](#aliases-and-multiple-files). But there are usually workarounds;
for example, put `alias` directives in your top-most file, before
including other files.

The restriction, though it may be annoying at first, is in a good cause;
it allows reports to be stable and deterministic, independent of the
order of input. Without it, reports could show different numbers
depending on the order of -f options, or the positions of include
directives in your files.

#### Directive effects

Here are all hledger\'s directives, with their effects and scope
summarised - nine main directives, plus four others which we consider
non-essential:

| directive                                               | what it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ends at file end?   |

### `account` directive

`account` directives can be used to declare accounts (ie, the places
that amounts are transferred from and to). Though not required, these
declarations can provide several benefits:

-   They can document your intended chart of accounts, providing a
    reference.
-   In [strict mode](#strict-mode), they restrict which accounts may be
    posted to by transactions, which helps detect typos.
-   They control account display order in reports, allowing
    non-alphabetic sorting (eg Revenues to appear above Expenses).
-   They help with account name completion (in hledger add, hledger-web,
    hledger-iadd, ledger-mode, etc.)
-   They can store additional account information as
    [comments](#account-comments), or as [tags](#tags) which can be used
    to filter or pivot reports.
-   They can help hledger know your accounts\' types (asset, liability,
    equity, revenue, expense), affecting reports like
    [balancesheet](#balancesheet) and
    [incomestatement](#incomestatement).

They are written as the word `account` followed by a hledger-style
[account name](#account-names), eg:

``` journal
account assets:bank:checking
```

Note, however, that accounts declared in account directives are not
allowed to have surrounding brackets and parentheses, unlike accounts
used in postings. So the following journal will not parse:

``` journal
account (assets:bank:checking)
```

#### Account comments

Text following **two or more spaces** and `;` at the end of an account
directive line, and/or following `;` on indented lines immediately below
it, form comments for that account. They are ignored except they may
contain [tags](#tags), which are not ignored.

The two-space requirement for same-line account comments is because `;`
is allowed in account names.

``` journal
account assets:bank:checking    ; same-line comment, at least 2 spaces before the semicolon
  ; next-line comment
  ; some tags - type:A, acctnum:12345
```

#### Account subdirectives

Ledger-style indented subdirectives are also accepted, but currently
ignored:

``` journal
account assets:bank:checking
  format subdirective is ignored
```

#### Account error checking

By default, accounts need not be declared; they come into existence when
a posting references them. This is convenient, but it means hledger
can\'t warn you when you mis-spell an account name in the journal.
Usually you\'ll find that error later, as an extra account in balance
reports, or an incorrect balance when reconciling.

In [strict mode](#strict-mode), enabled with the `-s`/`--strict` flag,
hledger will report an error if any transaction uses an account name
that has not been declared by an [account directive](#account). Some
notes:

-   The declaration is case-sensitive; transactions must use the correct
    account name capitalisation.
-   The account directive\'s scope is \"whole file and below\" (see
    [directives](#directives)). This means it affects all of the current
    file, and any files it includes, but not parent or sibling files.
    The position of account directives within the file does not matter,
    though it\'s usual to put them at the top.
-   Accounts can only be declared in `journal` files, but will affect
    [included](#include-directive) files of all types.
-   It\'s currently not possible to declare \"all possible subaccounts\"
    with a wildcard; every account posted to must be declared.

#### Account display order

The order in which account directives are written influences the order
in which accounts appear in reports, hledger-ui, hledger-web etc. By
default accounts appear in alphabetical order, but if you add these
account directives to the journal file:

``` journal
account assets
account liabilities
account equity
account revenues
account expenses
```

those accounts will be displayed in declaration order:

``` shell
$ hledger accounts -1
assets
liabilities
equity
revenues
expenses
```

Any undeclared accounts are displayed last, in alphabetical order.

Sorting is done at each level of the account tree, within each group of
sibling accounts under the same parent. And currently, this directive:

``` journal
account other:zoo
```

would influence the position of `zoo` among `other`\'s subaccounts, but
not the position of `other` among the top-level accounts. This means:

-   you will sometimes declare parent accounts (eg `account other`
    above) that you don\'t intend to post to, just to customize their
    display order
-   sibling accounts stay together (you couldn\'t display `x:y` in
    between `a:b` and `a:c`).

#### Account types

hledger knows that accounts come in several types: assets, liabilities,
expenses and so on. This enables easy reports like
[balancesheet](#balancesheet) and [incomestatement](#incomestatement),
and filtering by account type with the [`type:` query](#queries).

As a convenience, hledger will detect these account types automatically
if you are using common english-language top-level account names
(described below). But generally we recommend you declare types
explicitly, by adding a `type:` [tag](#tags) to your top-level account
directives. Subaccounts will inherit the type of their parent. The
tag\'s value should be one of the [five main account
types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart_of_accounts#Types_of_accounts):

-   `A` or `Asset` (things you own)
-   `L` or `Liability` (things you owe)
-   `E` or `Equity` (investment/ownership; balanced counterpart of
    assets & liabilities)
-   `R` or `Revenue` (what you received money from, AKA income;
    technically part of Equity)
-   `X` or `Expense` (what you spend money on; technically part of
    Equity)

or, it can be (these are used less often):

-   `C` or `Cash` (a subtype of Asset, indicating [liquid
    assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_and_cash_equivalents) for
    the [cashflow](#cashflow) report)
-   `V` or `Conversion` (a subtype of Equity, for conversions (see [COST
    REPORTING](#cost-reporting)).)

Here is a typical set of account type declarations:

``` journal
account assets             ; type: A
account liabilities        ; type: L
account equity             ; type: E
account revenues           ; type: R
account expenses           ; type: X

account assets:bank        ; type: C
account assets:cash        ; type: C

account equity:conversion  ; type: V
```

Here are some tips for working with account types.

-   The rules for inferring types from account names are as follows.
    These are just a convenience that sometimes help new users get
    going; if they don\'t work for you, just ignore them and declare
    your account types. See also [Regular
    expressions](#regular-expressions).

        If account's name contains this (CI) regular expression:            | its type is:
        --------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------
        ^assets?(:.+)?:(cash|bank|che(ck|que?)(ing)?|savings?|current)(:|$) | Cash
        ^assets?(:|$)                                                       | Asset
        ^(debts?|liabilit(y|ies))(:|$)                                      | Liability
        ^equity:(trad(e|ing)|conversion)s?(:|$)                             | Conversion
        ^equity(:|$)                                                        | Equity
        ^(income|revenue)s?(:|$)                                            | Revenue
        ^expenses?(:|$)                                                     | Expense

-   If you declare any account types, it\'s a good idea to declare an
    account for all of the account types, because a mixture of declared
    and name-inferred types can disrupt certain reports.

-   Certain uses of [account aliases](#alias-directive) can disrupt
    account types. See [Rewriting accounts \> Aliases and account
    types](#aliases-and-account-types).

-   As mentioned above, subaccounts will inherit a type from their
    parent account. More precisely, an account\'s type is decided by the
    first of these that exists:

    1.  A `type:` declaration for this account.
    2.  A `type:` declaration in the parent accounts above it,
        preferring the nearest.
    3.  An account type inferred from this account\'s name.
    4.  An account type inferred from a parent account\'s name,
        preferring the nearest parent.
    5.  Otherwise, it will have no type.

-   For troubleshooting, you can list accounts and their types with:

        $ hledger accounts --types [ACCTPAT] [-DEPTH] [type:TYPECODES]

### `alias` directive

You can define account alias rules which rewrite your account names, or
parts of them, before generating reports. This can be useful for:

-   expanding shorthand account names to their full form, allowing
    easier data entry and a less verbose journal
-   adapting old journals to your current chart of accounts
-   experimenting with new account organisations, like a new hierarchy
-   combining two accounts into one, eg to see their sum or difference
    on one line
-   customising reports

Account aliases also rewrite account names in [account
directives](#account). They do not affect account names being entered
via hledger add or hledger-web.

Account aliases are very powerful. They are generally easy to use
correctly, but you can also generate invalid account names with them;
more on this below.

See also [Rewrite account names](/rewrite-account-names.html).

#### Basic aliases

To set an account alias, use the `alias` directive in your journal file.
This affects all subsequent journal entries in the current file or its
[included files](#include-directive) (but note: [not sibling or parent
files](#aliases-and-multiple-files)). The spaces around the = are
optional:

``` journal
alias OLD = NEW
```

Or, you can use the `--alias 'OLD=NEW'` option on the command line. This
affects all entries. It\'s useful for trying out aliases interactively.

OLD and NEW are case sensitive full account names. hledger will replace
any occurrence of the old account name with the new one. Subaccounts are
also affected. Eg:

``` journal
alias checking = assets:bank:wells fargo:checking
; rewrites "checking" to "assets:bank:wells fargo:checking", or "checking:a" to "assets:bank:wells fargo:checking:a"
```

#### Regex aliases

There is also a more powerful variant that uses a [regular
expression](#regular-expressions), indicated by wrapping the pattern in
forward slashes. (This is the only place where hledger requires forward
slashes around a regular expression.)

Eg:

``` journal
alias /REGEX/ = REPLACEMENT
```

or:

``` cli
$ hledger --alias '/REGEX/=REPLACEMENT' ...
```

Any part of an account name matched by REGEX will be replaced by
REPLACEMENT. REGEX is case-insensitive as usual.

If you need to match a forward slash, escape it with a backslash, eg
`/\/=:`.

If REGEX contains parenthesised match groups, these can be referenced by
the usual backslash and number in REPLACEMENT:

``` journal
alias /^(.+):bank:([^:]+):(.*)/ = \1:\2 \3
; rewrites "assets:bank:wells fargo:checking" to  "assets:wells fargo checking"
```

REPLACEMENT continues to the end of line (or on command line, to end of
option argument), so it can contain trailing whitespace.

#### Combining aliases

You can define as many aliases as you like, using journal directives
and/or command line options.

Recursive aliases - where an account name is rewritten by one alias,
then by another alias, and so on - are allowed. Each alias sees the
effect of previously applied aliases.

In such cases it can be important to understand which aliases will be
applied and in which order. For (each account name in) each journal
entry, we apply:

1.  `alias` directives preceding the journal entry, most recently parsed
    first (ie, reading upward from the journal entry, bottom to top)
2.  `--alias` options, in the order they appeared on the command line
    (left to right).

In other words, for (an account name in) a given journal entry:

-   the nearest alias declaration before/above the entry is applied
    first
-   the next alias before/above that will be be applied next, and so on
-   aliases defined after/below the entry do not affect it.

This gives nearby aliases precedence over distant ones, and helps
provide semantic stability - aliases will keep working the same way
independent of which files are being read and in which order.

In case of trouble, adding `--debug=6` to the command line will show
which aliases are being applied when.

#### Aliases and multiple files

As explained at [Directives and multiple
files](#directives-and-multiple-files), `alias` directives do not affect
parent or sibling files. Eg in this command,

``` shell
hledger -f a.aliases -f b.journal
```

account aliases defined in a.aliases will not affect b.journal.
Including the aliases doesn\'t work either:

``` journal
include a.aliases

2023-01-01  ; not affected by a.aliases
  foo  1
  bar
```

This means that account aliases should usually be declared at the start
of your top-most file, like this:

``` journal
alias foo=Foo
alias bar=Bar

2023-01-01  ; affected by aliases above
  foo  1
  bar

include c.journal  ; also affected
```

#### `end aliases` directive

You can clear (forget) all currently defined aliases (seen in the
journal so far, or defined on the command line) with this directive:

``` journal
end aliases
```

#### Aliases can generate bad account names

Be aware that account aliases can produce malformed account names, which
could cause confusing reports or invalid [`print`](#print) output. For
example, you could erase all account names:

``` journal
2021-01-01
  a:aa     1
  b
```

``` shell
$ hledger print --alias '/.*/='
2021-01-01
                   1
```

The above `print` output is not a valid journal. Or you could insert an
illegal double space, causing `print` output that would give a different
journal when reparsed:

``` journal
2021-01-01
  old    1
  other
```

``` shell
$ hledger print --alias old="new  USD" | hledger -f- print
2021-01-01
    new             USD 1
    other
```

#### Aliases and account types

If an account with a type declaration (see [Declaring accounts \>
Account types](#account-types)) is renamed by an alias, normally the
account type remains in effect.

However, renaming in a way that reshapes the account tree (eg renaming
parent accounts but not their children, or vice versa) could prevent
child accounts from inheriting the account type of their parents.

Secondly, if an account\'s type is being inferred from its name,
renaming it by an alias could prevent or alter that.

If you are using account aliases and the [`type:` query](#queries) is
not matching accounts as you expect, try troubleshooting with the
accounts command, eg something like:

``` shell
$ hledger accounts --alias assets=bassetts type:a
```

### `commodity` directive

You can use `commodity` directives to declare your commodities. In fact
the `commodity` directive performs several functions at once:

1.  It declares commodities which may be used in the journal. This can
    optionally be enforced, providing useful error checking. (Cf
    [Commodity error checking](#commodity-error-checking))

2.  It declares which decimal mark character (period or comma), to
    expect when parsing input - useful to disambiguate international
    number formats in your data. Without this, hledger will parse both
    `1,000` and `1.000` as 1. (Cf [Amounts](#amounts))

3.  It declares how to render the commodity\'s amounts when displaying
    output - the decimal mark, any digit group marks, the number of
    decimal places, symbol placement and so on. (Cf [Commodity display
    style](#commodity-display-style))

You will run into one of the problems solved by commodity directives
sooner or later, so we recommend using them, for robust and predictable
parsing and display.

Generally you should put them at the top of your journal file (since for
function 2, they affect only following amounts, cf
[#793](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/793)).

A commodity directive is just the word `commodity` followed by a sample
[amount](#amounts), like this:

``` journal
;commodity SAMPLEAMOUNT

commodity $1000.00
commodity 1,000.0000 AAAA  ; optional same-line comment
```

It may also be written on multiple lines, and use the `format`
subdirective, as in Ledger. Note in this case the commodity symbol
appears twice; it must be the same in both places:

``` journal
;commodity SYMBOL
;  format SAMPLEAMOUNT

; display indian rupees with currency name on the left,
; thousands, lakhs and crores comma-separated,
; period as decimal point, and two decimal places.
commodity INR
  format INR 1,00,00,000.00
```

Other indented subdirectives are currently ignored.

Remember that if the commodity symbol contains spaces, numbers, or
punctuation, it must be enclosed in double quotes (cf
[Commodity](#commodity)).

The amount\'s quantity does not matter; only the format is significant.
It must include a decimal mark - either a period or a comma - followed
by 0 or more decimal digits.

A few more examples:

``` journal
# number formats for $, EUR, INR and the no-symbol commodity:
commodity $1,000.00
commodity EUR 1.000,00
commodity INR 9,99,99,999.0
commodity 1 000 000.
```

Note hledger normally uses [banker\'s
rounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankers_rounding), so 0.5
displayed with zero decimal digits is \"0\". (More at [Commodity display
style](#commodity-display-style).)

Even in the presence of commodity directives, the commodity display
style can still be [overridden](#commodity-styles) by supplying a
command line option.

#### Commodity error checking

In [strict mode](#strict-mode), enabled with the `-s`/`--strict` flag,
hledger will report an error if a commodity symbol is used that has not
been declared by a [`commodity` directive](#commodity-directive). This
works similarly to [account error checking](#account-error-checking),
see the notes there for more details.

Note, this disallows amounts without a commodity symbol, because
currently it\'s not possible (?) to declare the \"no-symbol\" commodity
with a directive. This is one exception for convenience: zero amounts
are always allowed to have no commodity symbol.

### `decimal-mark` directive

You can use a `decimal-mark` directive - usually one per file, at the
top of the file - to declare which character represents a decimal mark
when parsing amounts in this file. It can look like

``` journal
decimal-mark .
```

or

``` journal
decimal-mark ,
```

This prevents any [ambiguity](#decimal-marks-digit-group-marks) when
parsing numbers in the file, so we recommend it, especially if the file
contains digit group marks (eg thousands separators).

### `include` directive

You can pull in the content of additional files by writing an include
directive, like this:

``` journal
include FILEPATH
```

Only journal files can include, and only journal, timeclock or timedot
files can be included (not CSV files, currently).

If the file path does not begin with a slash, it is relative to the
current file\'s folder.

A tilde means home directory, eg: `include ~/main.journal`.

The path may contain [glob
patterns](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Glob-0.9.2/docs/System-FilePath-Glob.html#v:compile)
to match multiple files, eg: `include *.journal`.

There is limited support for recursive wildcards: `**/` (the slash is
required) matches 0 or more subdirectories. It\'s not super convenient
since you have to avoid include cycles and including directories, but
this can be done, eg: `include */**/*.journal`.

The path may also be prefixed to force a specific file format,
overriding the file extension (as described in [hledger.1 -\> Input
files](#input-files)): `include timedot:~/notes/2023*.md`.

### `P` directive

The `P` directive declares a market price, which is a conversion rate
between two commodities on a certain date. This allows [value
reports](#valuation) to convert amounts of one commodity to their value
in another, on or after that date. These prices are often obtained from
a [stock exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange),
[cryptocurrency
exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange), the or
[foreign exchange
market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market).

The format is:

``` journal
P DATE COMMODITY1SYMBOL COMMODITY2AMOUNT
```

DATE is a [simple date](#simple-dates), COMMODITY1SYMBOL is the symbol
of the commodity being priced, and COMMODITY2AMOUNT is the
[amount](#amounts) (symbol and quantity) of commodity 2 that one unit of
commodity 1 is worth on this date. Examples:

``` journal
# one euro was worth $1.35 from 2009-01-01 onward:
P 2009-01-01 € $1.35

# and $1.40 from 2010-01-01 onward:
P 2010-01-01 € $1.40
```

The `-V`, `-X` and `--value` flags use these market prices to show
amount values in another commodity. See [Valuation](#valuation).

<a name="automated-postings"></a>

### `payee` directive

`payee PAYEE NAME`

This directive can be used to declare a limited set of payees which may
appear in [transaction descriptions](#descriptions). The [\"payees\"
check](#check) will report an error if any transaction refers to a payee
that has not been declared. Eg:

``` journal
payee Whole Foods
```

Any indented subdirectives are currently ignored.

### `tag` directive

`tag TAGNAME`

This directive can be used to declare a limited set of tag names allowed
in [tags](#tags). TAGNAME should be a valid tag name (no spaces). Eg:

``` journal
tag  item-id
```

Any indented subdirectives are currently ignored.

The [\"tags\" check](#check) will report an error if any undeclared tag
name is used. It is quite easy to accidentally create a tag through
normal use of colons in [comments](#comments)(#comments\]; if you want
to prevent this, you can declare and check your tags .

### Periodic transactions

The `~` directive declares recurring transactions. Such directives allow
hledger to generate temporary future transactions (visible in reports,
not in the journal file) to help with [forecasting](#forecasting) or
[budgeting](#budgeting).

Periodic transactions can be a little tricky, so before you use them,
read this whole section, or at least these tips:

1.  Two spaces accidentally added or omitted will cause you trouble -
    read about this below.
2.  For troubleshooting, show the generated transactions with
    `hledger print --forecast tag:generated` or
    `hledger register --forecast tag:generated`.
3.  Forecasted transactions will begin only after the last
    non-forecasted transaction\'s date.
4.  Forecasted transactions will end 6 months from today, by default.
    See below for the exact start/end rules.
5.  [period expressions](#period-expressions) can be tricky. Their
    documentation needs improvement, but is worth studying.
6.  Some period expressions with a repeating interval must begin on a
    natural boundary of that interval. Eg in `weekly from DATE`, DATE
    must be a monday. `~ weekly from 2019/10/1` (a tuesday) will give an
    error.
7.  Other period expressions with an interval are automatically expanded
    to cover a whole number of that interval. (This is done to improve
    reports, but it also affects periodic transactions. Yes, it\'s a bit
    inconsistent with the above.) Eg: <br>
    `~ every 10th day of month from 2023/01`, which is equivalent to
    <br> `~ every 10th day of month from 2023/01/01`, will be adjusted
    to start on 2019/12/10.

#### Periodic rule syntax

A periodic transaction rule looks like a normal journal entry, with the
date replaced by a tilde (`~`) followed by a [period
expression](#period-expressions) (mnemonic: `~` looks like a recurring
sine wave.):

``` journal
# every first of month
~ monthly
    expenses:rent          $2000
    assets:bank:checking

# every 15th of month in 2023's first quarter:
~ monthly from 2023-04-15 to 2023-06-16
    expenses:utilities          $400
    assets:bank:checking
```

The period expression is the same syntax used for specifying
multi-period reports, just interpreted differently; there, it specifies
report periods; here it specifies recurrence dates (the periods\' start
dates).

#### Periodic rules and relative dates

Partial or relative dates (like `12/31`, `25`, `tomorrow`, `last week`,
`next quarter`) are usually not recommended in periodic rules, since the
results will change as time passes. If used, they will be interpreted
relative to, in order of preference:

1.  the first day of the default year specified by a recent `Y`
    directive
2.  or the date specified with `--today`
3.  or the date on which you are running the report.

They will not be affected at all by report period or forecast period
dates.

#### Two spaces between period expression and description!

If the period expression is followed by a transaction description, these
must be separated by **two or more spaces**. This helps hledger know
where the period expression ends, so that descriptions can not
accidentally alter their meaning, as in this example:

    ; 2 or more spaces needed here, so the period is not understood as "every 2 months in 2023"
    ;               ||
    ;               vv
    ~ every 2 months  in 2023, we will review
        assets:bank:checking   $1500
        income:acme inc

So,

-   Do write two spaces between your period expression and your
    transaction description, if any.
-   Don\'t accidentally write two spaces in the middle of your period
    expression.

### Auto postings

The `=` directive declares a rule for generating temporary extra
postings on transactions. Wherever the rule matches an existing posting,
it can add one or more companion postings below that one, optionally
influenced by the matched posting\'s amount. This can be useful for
generating tax postings with a standard percentage, for example.

Note that depending on generated data is not ideal for financial records
(it\'s less portable, less future-proof, less auditable by others, and
less robust, since other features like balance assertions will depend on
using or not using `--auto`).

An auto posting rule looks a bit like a transaction:

``` journal
= QUERY
    ACCOUNT  AMOUNT
    ...
    ACCOUNT  [AMOUNT]
```

except the first line is an equals sign (mnemonic: `=` suggests
matching), followed by a [query](#queries) (which matches existing
postings), and each \"posting\" line describes a posting to be
generated, and the posting amounts can be:

-   a normal amount with a commodity symbol, eg `$2`. This will be used
    as-is.
-   a number, eg `2`. The commodity symbol (if any) from the matched
    posting will be added to this.
-   a numeric multiplier, eg `*2` (a star followed by a number N). The
    matched posting\'s amount (and total price, if any) will be
    multiplied by N.
-   a multiplier with a commodity symbol, eg `*$2` (a star, number N,
    and symbol S). The matched posting\'s amount will be multiplied by
    N, and its commodity symbol will be replaced with S.

Any query term containing spaces must be enclosed in single or double
quotes, as on the command line. Eg, note the quotes around the second
query term below:

``` journal
= expenses:groceries 'expenses:dining out'
    (budget:funds:dining out)                 *-1
```

Some examples:

``` journal
; every time I buy food, schedule a dollar donation
= expenses:food
    (liabilities:charity)   $-1

; when I buy a gift, also deduct that amount from a budget envelope subaccount
= expenses:gifts
    assets:checking:gifts  *-1
    assets:checking         *1

2017/12/1
  expenses:food    $10
  assets:checking

2017/12/14
  expenses:gifts   $20
  assets:checking
```

``` shell
$ hledger print --auto
2017-12-01
    expenses:food              $10
    assets:checking
    (liabilities:charity)      $-1

2017-12-14
    expenses:gifts             $20
    assets:checking
    assets:checking:gifts     -$20
    assets:checking            $20
```

##### Auto postings and multiple files

An auto posting rule can affect any transaction in the current file, or
in any parent file or child file. Note, currently it will not affect
sibling files (when multiple `-f`/`--file` are used - see
[#1212](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1212)).

##### Auto postings and dates

A [posting date](#posting-dates) (or secondary date) in the matched
posting, or (taking precedence) a posting date in the auto posting rule
itself, will also be used in the generated posting.

##### Auto postings and transaction balancing / inferred amounts / balance assertions

Currently, auto postings are added:

-   after [missing amounts are inferred, and transactions are checked
    for balancedness](#postings),
-   but before [balance assertions](#balance-assertions) are checked.

Note this means that journal entries must be balanced both before and
after auto postings are added. This changed in hledger 1.12+; see
[#893](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/893) for
background.

This also means that you cannot have more than one auto-posting with a
missing amount applied to a given transaction, as it will be unable to
infer amounts.

##### Auto posting tags

Automated postings will have some extra [tags](#tags):

-   `generated-posting:= QUERY` - shows this was generated by an auto
    posting rule, and the query
-   `_generated-posting:= QUERY` - a hidden tag, which does not appear
    in hledger\'s output. This can be used to match postings generated
    \"just now\", rather than generated in the past and saved to the
    journal.

Also, any transaction that has been changed by auto posting rules will
have these tags added:

-   `modified:` - this transaction was modified
-   `_modified:` - a hidden tag not appearing in the comment; this
    transaction was modified \"just now\".

##### Auto postings on forecast transactions only

Tip: you can can make auto postings that will apply to forecast
transactions but not recorded transactions, by adding
`tag:_generated-transaction` to their QUERY. This can be useful when
generating new journal entries to be saved in the journal.

### Other syntax

hledger journal format supports quite a few other features, mainly to
make interoperating with or converting from Ledger easier. Note some of
the features below are powerful and can be useful in special cases, but
in general, features in this section are considered less important or
even not recommended for most users. Downsides are mentioned to help you
decide if you want to use them.

#### Balance assignments

[Ledger-style balance
assignments](http://ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Balance-assignments)
are also supported. These are like [balance
assertions](#balance-assertions), but with no posting amount on the left
side of the equals sign; instead it is calculated automatically so as to
satisfy the assertion. This can be a convenience during data entry, eg
when setting opening balances:

``` journal
; starting a new journal, set asset account balances
2016/1/1 opening balances
  assets:checking            = $409.32
  assets:savings             = $735.24
  assets:cash                 = $42
  equity:opening balances
```

or when adjusting a balance to reality:

``` journal
; no cash left; update balance, record any untracked spending as a generic expense
2016/1/15
  assets:cash    = $0
  expenses:misc
```

The calculated amount depends on the account\'s balance in the commodity
at that point (which depends on the previously-dated postings of the
commodity to that account since the last balance assertion or
assignment).

Downsides: using balance assignments makes your journal less explicit;
to know the exact amount posted, you have to run hledger or do the
calculations yourself, instead of just reading it. Also balance
assignments\' forcing of balances can hide errors. These things make
your financial data less portable, less future-proof, and less
trustworthy in an audit.

##### Balance assignments and prices

A [cost](#costs) in a balance assignment will cause the calculated
amount to have that price attached:

``` journal
2019/1/1
  (a)             = $1 @ €2
```

    $ hledger print --explicit
    2019-01-01
        (a)         $1 @ €2 = $1 @ €2

#### Bracketed posting dates

For setting [posting dates](#posting-dates) and [secondary posting
dates](#secondary-dates), Ledger\'s bracketed date syntax is also
supported: `[DATE]`, `[DATE=DATE2]` or `[=DATE2]` in posting comments.
hledger will attempt to parse any square-bracketed sequence of the
`0123456789/-.=` characters in this way. With this syntax, DATE infers
its year from the transaction and DATE2 infers its year from DATE.

Downsides: another syntax to learn, redundant with hledger\'s
`date:`/`date2:` tags, and confusingly similar to Ledger\'s lot date
syntax.

#### `D` directive

`D AMOUNT`

This directive sets a default commodity, to be used for any subsequent
commodityless amounts (ie, plain numbers) seen while parsing the
journal. This effect lasts until the next `D` directive, or the end of
the journal.

For compatibility/historical reasons, `D` also acts like a [`commodity`
directive](#commodity-directive) (setting the commodity\'s decimal mark
for parsing and [display style](#amount-display-format) for output). So
its argument is not just a commodity symbol, but a full amount
demonstrating the style. The amount must include a decimal mark (either
period or comma). Eg:

``` journal
; commodity-less amounts should be treated as dollars
; (and displayed with the dollar sign on the left, thousands separators and two decimal places)
D $1,000.00

1/1
  a     5  ; <- commodity-less amount, parsed as $5 and displayed as $5.00
  b
```

Interactions with other directives:

For setting a commodity\'s display style, a `commodity` directive has
highest priority, then a `D` directive.

For detecting a commodity\'s decimal mark during parsing, `decimal-mark`
has highest priority, then `commodity`, then `D`.

For checking commodity symbols with the [check command](#check), a
`commodity` directive is required (`hledger check commodities` ignores
`D` directives).

Downsides: omitting commodity symbols makes your financial data less
explicit, less portable, and less trustworthy in an audit. It is usually
an unsustainable shortcut; sooner or later you will want to track
multiple commodities. D is overloaded with functions redundant with
`commodity` and `decimal-mark`. And it works differently from Ledger\'s
`D`.

#### `apply account` directive

This directive sets a default parent account, which will be prepended to
all accounts in following entries, until an `end apply account`
directive or end of current file. Eg:

``` journal
apply account home

2010/1/1
    food    $10
    cash

end apply account
```

is equivalent to:

``` journal
2010/01/01
    home:food           $10
    home:cash          $-10
```

`account` directives are also affected, and so is any `include`d
content.

Account names entered via hledger add or hledger-web are not affected.

Account aliases, if any, are applied after the parent account is
prepended.

Downsides: this can make your financial data less explicit, less
portable, and less trustworthy in an audit.

#### `Y` directive

`Y YEAR`

or (deprecated backward-compatible forms):

`year YEAR` `apply year YEAR`

The space is optional. This sets a default year to be used for
subsequent dates which don\'t specify a year. Eg:

``` journal
Y2009  ; set default year to 2009

12/15  ; equivalent to 2009/12/15
  expenses  1
  assets

year 2010  ; change default year to 2010

2009/1/30  ; specifies the year, not affected
  expenses  1
  assets

1/31   ; equivalent to 2010/1/31
  expenses  1
  assets
```

Downsides: omitting the year (from primary transaction dates, at least)
makes your financial data less explicit, less portable, and less
trustworthy in an audit. Such dates can get separated from their
corresponding Y directive, eg when evaluating a region of the journal in
your editor. A missing Y directive makes reports dependent on today\'s
date.

#### Secondary dates

A secondary date is written after the primary date, following an equals
sign. If the year is omitted, the primary date\'s year is assumed. When
running reports, the primary (left) date is used by default, but with
the `--date2` flag (or `--aux-date` or `--effective`), the secondary
(right) date will be used instead.

The meaning of secondary dates is up to you, but it\'s best to follow a
consistent rule. Eg \"primary = the bank\'s clearing date, secondary =
date the transaction was initiated, if different\".

Downsides: makes your financial data more complicated, less portable,
and less trustworthy in an audit. Keeping the meaning of the two dates
consistent requires discipline, and you have to remember which reporting
mode is appropriate for a given report. [Posting dates](#posting-dates)
are simpler and better.

#### Star comments

Lines beginning with `*` (star/asterisk) are also comment lines. This
feature allows Emacs users to insert org headings in their journal,
allowing them to fold/unfold/navigate it like an outline when viewed
with org mode.

Downsides: another, unconventional comment syntax to learn. Decreases
your journal\'s portability. And switching to Emacs org mode just for
folding/unfolding meant losing the benefits of ledger mode; nowadays you
can add outshine mode to ledger mode to get folding without losing
ledger mode\'s features.

#### Valuation expressions

Ledger allows a valuation function or value to be written in double
parentheses after an amount. hledger ignores these.

#### Virtual postings

A posting with parentheses around the account name (`(some:account)`) is
called a *unbalanced virtual posting*. Such postings do not participate
in transaction balancing. (And if you write them without an amount, a
zero amount is always inferred.) These can occasionally be convenient
for special circumstances, but they violate double entry bookkeeping and
make your data less portable across applications, so many people avoid
using them at all.

A posting with brackets around the account name (`[some:account]`) is
called a *balanced virtual posting*. The balanced virtual postings in a
transaction must add up to zero, just like ordinary postings, but
separately from them. These are not part of double entry bookkeeping
either, but they are at least balanced. An example:

``` journal
2022-01-01 buy food with cash, update budget envelope subaccounts, & something else
  assets:cash                    $-10  ; <- these balance each other
  expenses:food                    $7  ; <-
  expenses:food                    $3  ; <-
  [assets:checking:budget:food]  $-10  ;   <- and these balance each other
  [assets:checking:available]     $10  ;   <-
  (something:else)                 $5  ;     <- this is not required to balance
```

Ordinary postings, whose account names are neither parenthesised nor
bracketed, are called *real postings*. You can exclude virtual postings
from reports with the `-R/--real` flag or a `real:1` query.

#### Other Ledger directives

These other Ledger directives are currently accepted but ignored. This
allows hledger to read more Ledger files, but be aware that hledger\'s
reports may differ from Ledger\'s if you use these.

``` journal
apply fixed COMM AMT
apply tag   TAG
assert      EXPR
bucket / A  ACCT
capture     ACCT REGEX
check       EXPR
define      VAR=EXPR
end apply fixed
end apply tag
end apply year
end tag
eval / expr EXPR
python
  PYTHONCODE
tag         NAME
value       EXPR
--command-line-flags
```

See also <https://hledger.org/ledger.html> for a detailed hledger/Ledger
syntax comparison.

<a name="csv-format"></a>

## CSV

hledger can read
[CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files
(Character Separated Value - usually comma, semicolon, or tab)
containing dated records, automatically converting each record into a
transaction.

(To learn about *writing* CSV, see [CSV output](#csv-output).)

For best error messages when reading CSV/TSV/SSV files, make sure they
have a corresponding `.csv`, `.tsv` or `.ssv` file extension or use a
hledger file prefix (see [File Extension](#file-extension) below).

Each CSV file must be described by a corresponding *rules file*.\
This contains rules describing the CSV data (header line, fields layout,
date format etc.), how to construct hledger transactions from it, and
how to categorise transactions based on description or other attributes.

By default hledger looks for a rules file named like the CSV file with
an extra `.rules` extension, in the same directory. Eg when asked to
read `foo/FILE.csv`, hledger looks for `foo/FILE.csv.rules`. You can
specify a different rules file with the `--rules-file` option. If no
rules file is found, hledger will create a sample rules file, which
you\'ll need to adjust.

At minimum, the rules file must identify the date and amount fields, and
often it also specifies the date format and how many header lines there
are. Here\'s a simple CSV file and a rules file for it:

``` csv
Date, Description, Id, Amount
12/11/2019, Foo, 123, 10.23
```

``` rules
# basic.csv.rules
skip         1
fields       date, description, , amount
date-format  %d/%m/%Y
```

``` shell
$ hledger print -f basic.csv
2019-11-12 Foo
    expenses:unknown           10.23
    income:unknown            -10.23
```

There\'s an introductory [Importing CSV data](/import-csv.html) tutorial
on hledger.org, and more [CSV rules examples](#csv-rules-examples)
below, and a larger collection at
<https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/tree/master/examples/csv>.

### CSV rules cheatsheet

The following kinds of rule can appear in the rules file, in any order.

[Working with CSV](#working-with-csv) tips can be found below, including
[How CSV rules are evaluated](#how-csv-rules-are-evaluated).

### `source`

If you tell hledger to read a csv file with `-f foo.csv`, it will look
for rules in `foo.csv.rules`. Or, you can tell it to read the rules
file, with `-f foo.csv.rules`, and it will look for data in `foo.csv`
(since 1.30).

These are mostly equivalent, but the second method provides some extra
features. For one, the data file can be missing, without causing an
error; it is just considered empty. And, you can specify a different
data file by adding a \"source\" rule:

``` rules
source ./Checking1.csv
```

If you specify just a file name with no path, hledger will look for it
in your system\'s downloads directory (`~/Downloads`, currently):

``` rules
source Checking1.csv
```

And if you specify a glob pattern, hledger will read the most recent of
the matched files (useful with repeated downloads):

``` rules
source Checking1*.csv
```

See also [\"Working with CSV \> Reading files specified by
rule\"](#reading-files-specified-by-rule).

### `separator`

You can use the `separator` rule to read other kinds of
character-separated data. The argument is any single separator
character, or the words `tab` or `space` (case insensitive). Eg, for
comma-separated values (CSV):

``` rules
separator ,
```

or for semicolon-separated values (SSV):

``` rules
separator ;
```

or for tab-separated values (TSV):

``` rules
separator TAB
```

If the input file has a `.csv`, `.ssv` or `.tsv` [file
extension](#file-extension) (or a `csv:`, `ssv:`, `tsv:` prefix), the
appropriate separator will be inferred automatically, and you won\'t
need this rule.

### `skip`

``` rules
skip N
```

The word `skip` followed by a number (or no number, meaning 1) tells
hledger to ignore this many non-empty lines at the start of the input
data. You\'ll need this whenever your CSV data contains header lines.
Note, empty and blank lines are skipped automatically, so you don\'t
need to count those.

`skip` has a second meaning: it can be used inside [if
blocks](#if-block) (described below), to skip one or more records
whenever the condition is true. Records skipped in this way are ignored,
except they are still required to be [valid CSV](#valid-csv).

### `date-format`

``` rules
date-format DATEFMT
```

This is a helper for the `date` (and `date2`) fields. If your CSV dates
are not formatted like `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY/MM/DD` or `YYYY.MM.DD`,
you\'ll need to add a date-format rule describing them with a
strptime-style date parsing pattern - see
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time/docs/Data-Time-Format.html#v:formatTime>.
The pattern must parse the CSV date value completely. Some examples:

``` rules
# MM/DD/YY
date-format %m/%d/%y
```

``` rules
# D/M/YYYY
# The - makes leading zeros optional.
date-format %-d/%-m/%Y
```

``` rules
# YYYY-Mmm-DD
date-format %Y-%h-%d
```

``` rules
# M/D/YYYY HH:MM AM some other junk
# Note the time and junk must be fully parsed, though only the date is used.
date-format %-m/%-d/%Y %l:%M %p some other junk
```

### `timezone`

``` rules
timezone TIMEZONE
```

When CSV contains date-times that are implicitly in some time zone other
than yours, but containing no explicit time zone information, you can
use this rule to declare the CSV\'s native time zone, which helps
prevent off-by-one dates.

When the CSV date-times do contain time zone information, you don\'t
need this rule; instead, use `%Z` in `date-format` (or `%z`, `%EZ`,
`%Ez`; see the formatTime link above).

In either of these cases, hledger will do a time-zone-aware conversion,
localising the CSV date-times to your current system time zone. If you
prefer to localise to some other time zone, eg for reproducibility, you
can (on unix at least) set the output timezone with the TZ environment
variable, eg:

``` shell
$ TZ=-1000 hledger print -f foo.csv  # or TZ=-1000 hledger import foo.csv
```

`timezone` currently does not understand timezone names, except \"UTC\",
\"GMT\", \"EST\", \"EDT\", \"CST\", \"CDT\", \"MST\", \"MDT\", \"PST\",
or \"PDT\". For others, use numeric format: +HHMM or -HHMM.

### `newest-first`

hledger tries to ensure that the generated transactions will be ordered
chronologically, including intra-day transactions. Usually it can
auto-detect how the CSV records are ordered. But if it encounters CSV
where all records are on the same date, it assumes that the records are
oldest first. If in fact the CSV\'s records are normally newest first,
like:

``` csv
2022-10-01, txn 3...
2022-10-01, txn 2...
2022-10-01, txn 1...
```

you can add the `newest-first` rule to help hledger generate the
transactions in correct order.

``` rules
# same-day CSV records are newest first
newest-first
```

### `intra-day-reversed`

CSV records for each day are sometimes ordered in reverse compared to
the overall date order. Eg, here dates are newest first, but the
transactions on each date are oldest first:

``` csv
2022-10-02, txn 3...
2022-10-02, txn 4...
2022-10-01, txn 1...
2022-10-01, txn 2...
```

In this situation, add the `intra-day-reversed` rule, and hledger will
compensate, improving the order of transactions.

``` rules
# transactions within each day are reversed with respect to the overall date order
intra-day-reversed
```

### `decimal-mark`

``` rules
decimal-mark .
```

or:

``` rules
decimal-mark ,
```

hledger automatically accepts either period or comma as a decimal mark
when parsing numbers (cf [Amounts](#amounts)). However if any numbers in
the CSV contain digit group marks, such as thousand-separating commas,
you should declare the decimal mark explicitly with this rule, to avoid
misparsed numbers.

### `fields` list

``` rules
fields FIELDNAME1, FIELDNAME2, ...
```

A fields list (the word `fields` followed by comma-separated field
names) is optional, but convenient. It does two things:

1.  It names the CSV field in each column. This can be convenient if you
    are referencing them in other rules, so you can say `%SomeField`
    instead of remembering `%13`.

2.  Whenever you use one of the special [hledger field
    names](#field%20names) (described below), it assigns the CSV value
    in this position to that hledger field. This is the quickest way to
    populate hledger\'s fields and build a transaction.

Here\'s an example that says \"use the 1st, 2nd and 4th fields as the
transaction\'s date, description and amount; name the last two fields
for later reference; and ignore the others\":

``` rules
fields date, description, , amount, , , somefield, anotherfield
```

In a fields list, the separator is always comma; it is unrelated to the
CSV file\'s separator. Also:

-   There must be least two items in the list (at least one comma).
-   Field names may not contain spaces. Spaces before/after field names
    are optional.
-   Field names may contain `_` (underscore) or `-` (hyphen).
-   Fields you don\'t care about can be given a dummy name or an empty
    name.

If the CSV contains column headings, it\'s convenient to use these for
your field names, suitably modified (eg lower-cased with spaces replaced
by underscores).

Sometimes you may want to alter a CSV field name to avoid assigning to a
hledger field with the same name. Eg you could call the CSV\'s
\"balance\" field `balance_` to avoid directly setting hledger\'s
`balance` field (and generating a balance assertion).

### Field assignment

``` rules
HLEDGERFIELD FIELDVALUE
```

Field assignments are the more flexible way to assign CSV values to
hledger fields. They can be used instead of or in addition to a [fields
list](#fields-list) (see above).

To assign a value to a hledger field, write the [field
name](#field-names) (any of the standard hledger field/pseudo-field
names, defined below), a space, followed by a text value on the same
line. This text value may interpolate CSV fields, referenced by their
1-based position in the CSV record (`%N`), or by the name they were
given in the fields list (`%CSVFIELD`).

Some examples:

``` rules
# set the amount to the 4th CSV field, with " USD" appended
amount %4 USD

# combine three fields to make a comment, containing note: and date: tags
comment note: %somefield - %anotherfield, date: %1
```

Tips:

-   Interpolation strips outer whitespace (so a CSV value like `" 1 "`
    becomes `1` when interpolated)
    ([#1051](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1051)).
-   Interpolations always refer to a CSV field - you can\'t interpolate
    a hledger field. (See [Referencing other
    fields](#referencing-other-fields) below).

### Field names

Note the two kinds of field names mentioned here, and used only in
hledger CSV rules files:

1.  **CSV field names** (`CSVFIELD` in these docs): you can optionally
    name the CSV columns for easy reference (since hledger doesn\'t yet
    automatically recognise column headings in a CSV file), by writing
    arbitrary names in a `fields` list, eg:

    ``` csv
    fields When, What, Some_Id, Net, Total, Foo, Bar
    ```

2.  Special **hledger field names** (`HLEDGERFIELD` in these docs): you
    must set at least some of these to generate the hledger transaction
    from a CSV record, by writing them as the left hand side of a [field
    assignment](#field-assignment), eg:

    ``` csv
    date        %When
    code        %Some_Id
    description %What
    comment     %Foo %Bar
    amount1     $ %Total
    ```

    or directly in a [`fields` list](#fields-list):

    ``` csv
    fields date, description, code, , amount1, Foo, Bar
    currency $
    comment  %Foo %Bar
    ```

Here are all the special hledger field names available, and what happens
when you assign values to them:

#### date field

Assigning to `date` sets the [transaction date](#simple-dates).

#### date2 field

`date2` sets the transaction\'s [secondary date](#secondary-dates), if
any.

#### status field

`status` sets the transaction\'s [status](#status), if any.

#### code field

`code` sets the transaction\'s [code](#code), if any.

#### description field

`description` sets the transaction\'s [description](#description), if
any.

#### comment field

`comment` sets the transaction\'s [comment](#transaction-comments), if
any.

`commentN`, where N is a number, sets the Nth posting\'s comment.

You can assign multi-line comments by writing literal `\n` in the code.
A comment starting with `\n` will begin on a new line.

Comments can contain [tags](#tags), as usual.

#### account field

Assigning to `accountN`, where N is 1 to 99, sets the account name of
the Nth [posting](#postings), and causes that posting to be generated.

Most often there are two postings, so you\'ll want to set `account1` and
`account2`. Typically `account1` is associated with the CSV file, and is
set once with a top-level assignment, while `account2` is set based on
each transaction\'s description, in [conditional rules](#if-blocks).

If a posting\'s account name is left unset but its amount is set (see
below), a default account name will be chosen (like \"expenses:unknown\"
or \"income:unknown\").

#### amount field

Amount setting can get a bit complex. Assigning to `amount` is
sufficient for simple transactions, but there are four field name
variants you can use for different situations:

-   **`amountN` sets a specific posting\'s amount from one CSV field or
    arbitrary value.**\
    Assigning to `amountN` sets the amount of the Nth posting - and also
    causes that posting to be generated. N is most often 1 or 2 but can
    go up to 99, potentially generating a 99-posting transaction.
    (Posting numbers don\'t have to be consecutive; higher posting
    numbers can sometimes be useful with conditional rules, to ensure a
    certain ordering of postings.)

-   **`amountN-in/-out` sets a specific posting\'s amount from two CSV
    fields.**\
    When the amount is provided as two CSV fields -
    \"Debit\"/\"Credit\", \"Deposit\"/\"Withdrawal\", \"Money
    In\"/\"Money Out\" or similar - assign those fields to `amountN-in`
    and `amountN-out` respectively (or possibly the other way round,
    depending on signs). This will set the Nth posting\'s amount to
    whichever of the two CSV field values is non-zero. Some notes:

    -   Don\'t mix `amountN` and `amountN-in`/`-out`. When you have one
        CSV amount field, use `amountN`. When you have two CSV amount
        fields, use `amountN-in`/`amountN-out`.
    -   `amountN-in` and `amountN-out` are always used together, as a
        pair. Assign to both of them.
    -   They do not generate two separate postings; rather, they
        generate the Nth posting\'s single amount, from the value found
        in one or other of the two CSV fields.
    -   In each record, at least one of the two CSV fields must contain
        a zero amount or be empty.
    -   hledger assumes the two CSV fields contain unsigned numbers, and
        it will automatically negate the -out amount.
    -   This variant can be convenient, but it doesn\'t handle every
        two-amount-field situation; if you need more flexibility, use an
        `if` rule (see \"Setting amounts\" below).

The other two variants are older and considered legacy syntax, but can
still be convenient sometimes:

-   **`amount` sets posting 1 and 2\'s amounts from one CSV field or
    value.**\
    Assigning to `amount`, with no posting number,

    -   sets posting 1\'s amount (like `amount1`)
    -   sets posting 2\'s amount to the same amount but with opposite
        sign; and also converts it to cost if it has a [cost
        price](#costs)
    -   can be overridden by `amount1` and/or `amount2` assignments.
        (This helps with incremental migration of old rules files to the
        newer syntax.)

-   **`amount-in/-out` sets posting 1 and 2\'s amounts from two CSV
    fields.**\
    Assigning `amount-in` and `amount-out`, with no posting numbers, to
    two CSV fields reads whichever of the two values is non-zero as the
    amount, and then sets the first two posting amounts as above.

We recommend using only one of these variants within a rules file,
rather than mixing them. And remember that a `fields` list can also do
assignments, so eg naming a CSV field \"amount\" counts as an assignment
to `amount`; if you don\'t want that, call it something else, like
\"amount\_\".

In addition to this section, please see also the tips beginning at
[\"Working with CSV \> Setting amounts\"](#setting-amounts) below.

#### currency field

`currency` sets a currency symbol, to be prepended to all postings\'
amounts. You can use this if the CSV amounts do not have a currency
symbol, eg if it is in a separate column.

`currencyN` prepends a currency symbol to just the Nth posting\'s
amount.

#### balance field

`balanceN` sets a [balance assertion](#balance-assertions) amount (or if
the posting amount is left empty, a [balance
assignment](#balance-assignments)) on posting N.

`balance` is a compatibility spelling for hledger \<1.17; it is
equivalent to `balance1`.

You can adjust the type of assertion/assignment with the [`balance-type`
rule](#balance-type) (see below).

See [Tips](#tips) below for more about setting amounts and currency.

### `if` block

Rules can be applied conditionally, depending on patterns in the CSV
data. This allows flexibility; in particular, it is how you can
categorise transactions, selecting an appropriate account name based on
their description (for example). There are two ways to write conditional
rules: \"if blocks\", described here, and \"if tables\", described
below.

An if block is the word `if` and one or more \"matcher\" expressions
(can be a word or phrase), one per line, starting either on the same or
next line; followed by one or more indented rules. Eg,

``` rules
if MATCHER
 RULE
```

or

``` rules
if
MATCHER
MATCHER
MATCHER
 RULE
 RULE
```

If any of the matchers succeeds, all of the indented rules will be
applied. They are usually [field assignments](#field-assignments), but
the following special rules may also be used within an if block:

-   `skip` - skips the matched CSV record (generating no transaction
    from it)
-   `end` - skips the rest of the current CSV file.

Some examples:

``` rules
# if the record contains "groceries", set account2 to "expenses:groceries"
if groceries
 account2 expenses:groceries
```

``` rules
# if the record contains any of these phrases, set account2 and a transaction comment as shown
if
monthly service fee
atm transaction fee
banking thru software
 account2 expenses:business:banking
 comment  XXX deductible ? check it
```

``` rules
# if an empty record is seen (assuming five fields), ignore the rest of the CSV file
if ,,,,
 end
```

### Matchers

There are two kinds:

1.  A record matcher is a word or single-line text fragment or regular
    expression (`REGEX`), which hledger will try to match
    case-insensitively anywhere within the CSV record.\
    Eg: `whole foods`

2.  A field matcher is preceded with a percent sign and [CSV field
    name](#field-names) (`%CSVFIELD REGEX`). hledger will try to match
    these just within the named CSV field.\
    Eg: `%date 2023`

The regular expression is (as usual in hledger) a POSIX extended regular
expression, that also supports GNU word boundaries (`\b`, `\B`, `\<`,
`\>`), and nothing else. If you have trouble, see \"Regular
expressions\" in the hledger manual
(<https://hledger.org/hledger.html#regular-expressions>).

With record matchers, it\'s important to know that the record matched is
not the original CSV record, but a modified one: separators will be
converted to commas, and enclosing double quotes (but not enclosing
whitespace) are removed. So for example, when reading an SSV file, if
the original record was:

``` ssv
2023-01-01; "Acme, Inc.";  1,000
```

the regex would see, and try to match, this modified record text:

    2023-01-01,Acme, Inc.,  1,000

When an if block has multiple matchers, they are combined as follows:

-   By default they are OR\'d (any one of them can match)
-   When a matcher is preceded by ampersand (`&`) it will be AND\'ed
    with the previous matcher (both of them must match).

There\'s not yet an easy syntax to negate a matcher.

### `if` table

\"if tables\" are an alternative to [if blocks](#if-blocks); they can
express many matchers and field assignments in a more compact tabular
format, like this:

``` rules
if,HLEDGERFIELD1,HLEDGERFIELD2,...
MATCHERA,VALUE1,VALUE2,...
MATCHERB,VALUE1,VALUE2,...
MATCHERC,VALUE1,VALUE2,...
<empty line>
```

The first character after `if` is taken to be the separator for the rest
of the table. It should be a non-alphanumeric character like `,` or `|`
that does not appear anywhere else in the table. (Note: it is unrelated
to the CSV file\'s separator.) Whitespace can be used in the matcher
lines for readability, but not in the if line currently. The table must
be terminated by an empty line (or end of file). Each line must contain
the same number of separators; empty values are allowed.

The above means: try all of the matchers; whenever a matcher succeeds,
assign all of the values on that line to the corresponding hledger
fields; later lines can overrider earlier ones. It is equivalent to this
sequence of if blocks:

``` rules
if MATCHERA
  HLEDGERFIELD1 VALUE1
  HLEDGERFIELD2 VALUE2
  ...

if MATCHERB
  HLEDGERFIELD1 VALUE1
  HLEDGERFIELD2 VALUE2
  ...

if MATCHERC
  HLEDGERFIELD1 VALUE1
  HLEDGERFIELD2 VALUE2
  ...
```

Example:

``` rules
if,account2,comment
atm transaction fee,expenses:business:banking,deductible? check it
%description groceries,expenses:groceries,
2023/01/12.*Plumbing LLC,expenses:house:upkeep,emergency plumbing call-out
```

### `balance-type`

Balance assertions generated by [assigning to
balanceN](#posting-field-names) are of the simple `=` type by default,
which is a [single-commodity](#assertions-and-commodities),
[subaccount-excluding](#assertions-and-subaccounts) assertion. You may
find the subaccount-including variants more useful, eg if you have
created some virtual subaccounts of checking to help with budgeting. You
can select a different type of assertion with the `balance-type` rule:

``` rules
# balance assertions will consider all commodities and all subaccounts
balance-type ==*
```

Here are the balance assertion types for quick reference:

    =    single commodity, exclude subaccounts
    =*   single commodity, include subaccounts
    ==   multi commodity,  exclude subaccounts
    ==*  multi commodity,  include subaccounts

### `include`

``` rules
include RULESFILE
```

This includes the contents of another CSV rules file at this point.
`RULESFILE` is an absolute file path or a path relative to the current
file\'s directory. This can be useful for sharing common rules between
several rules files, eg:

``` rules
# someaccount.csv.rules

## someaccount-specific rules
fields   date,description,amount
account1 assets:someaccount
account2 expenses:misc

## common rules
include categorisation.rules
```

### Working with CSV

Some tips:

#### Rapid feedback

It\'s a good idea to get rapid feedback while creating/troubleshooting
CSV rules. Here\'s a good way, using entr from
[eradman.com/entrproject](https://eradman.com/entrproject):

``` shell
$ ls foo.csv* | entr bash -c 'echo ----; hledger -f foo.csv print desc:SOMEDESC'
```

A desc: query (eg) is used to select just one, or a few, transactions of
interest. \"bash -c\" is used to run multiple commands, so we can echo a
separator each time the command re-runs, making it easier to read the
output.

#### Valid CSV

Note that hledger will only accept valid CSV conforming to [RFC
4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180), and equivalent SSV and TSV
formats (like RFC 4180 but with semicolon or tab as separators). This
means, eg:

-   Values may be enclosed in double quotes, or not. Enclosing in single
    quotes is not allowed. (Eg `'A','B'` is rejected.)
-   When values are enclosed in double quotes, spaces outside the quotes
    are [not
    allowed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4863852/space-before-quote-in-csv-field).
    (Eg `"A", "B"` is rejected.)
-   When values are not enclosed in quotes, they may not contain double
    quotes. (Eg `A"A, B` is rejected.)

If your CSV/SSV/TSV is not valid in this sense, you\'ll need to
transform it before reading with hledger. Try using sed, or a more
permissive CSV parser like [python\'s csv
lib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html).

#### File Extension

To help hledger choose the CSV file reader and show the right error
messages (and choose the right field separator character by default),
it\'s best if CSV/SSV/TSV files are named with a `.csv`, `.ssv` or
`.tsv` filename extension. (More about this at [Data
formats](#data-formats).)

When reading files with the \"wrong\" extension, you can ensure the CSV
reader (and the default field separator) by prefixing the file path with
`csv:`, `ssv:` or `tsv:`: Eg:

``` shell
$ hledger -f ssv:foo.dat print
```

You can also override the default field separator with a
[separator](#separator) rule if needed.

#### Reading CSV from standard input

You\'ll need the file format prefix when reading CSV from stdin also,
since hledger assumes journal format by default. Eg:

    $ cat foo.dat | hledger -f ssv:- print

#### Reading multiple CSV files

If you use multiple `-f` options to read multiple CSV files at once,
hledger will look for a correspondingly-named rules file for each CSV
file. But if you use the `--rules-file` option, that rules file will be
used for all the CSV files.

#### Reading files specified by rule

Instead of specifying a CSV file in the command line, you can specify a
rules file, as in `hledger -f foo.csv.rules CMD`. By default this will
read data from foo.csv in the same directory, but you can add a
[source](#source) rule to specify a different data file, perhaps located
in your web browser\'s download directory.

This feature was added in hledger 1.30, so you won\'t see it in most CSV
rules examples. But it helps remove some of the busywork of managing CSV
downloads. Most of your financial institutions\'s default CSV filenames
are different and can be recognised by a glob pattern. So you can put a
rule like `source Checking1*.csv` in foo-checking.csv.rules, and then
periodically follow a workflow like:

1.  Download CSV from Foo\'s website, using your browser\'s defaults
2.  Run `hledger import foo-checking.csv.rules` to import any new
    transactions

After import, you can: discard the CSV, or leave it where it is for a
while, or move it into your archives, as you prefer. If you do nothing,
next time your browser will save something like Checking1-2.csv, and
hledger will use that because of the `*` wild card and because it is the
most recent.

#### Valid transactions

After reading a CSV file, hledger post-processes and validates the
generated journal entries as it would for a journal file - balancing
them, applying balance assignments, and canonicalising amount styles.
Any errors at this stage will be reported in the usual way, displaying
the problem entry.

There is one exception: balance assertions, if you have generated them,
will not be checked, since normally these will work only when the CSV
data is part of the main journal. If you do need to check balance
assertions generated from CSV right away, pipe into another hledger:

``` shell
$ hledger -f file.csv print | hledger -f- print
```

#### Deduplicating, importing

When you download a CSV file periodically, eg to get your latest bank
transactions, the new file may overlap with the old one, containing some
of the same records.

The [import](#import) command will (a) detect the new transactions, and
(b) append just those transactions to your main journal. It is
idempotent, so you don\'t have to remember how many times you ran it or
with which version of the CSV. (It keeps state in a hidden
`.latest.FILE.csv` file.) This is the easiest way to import CSV data.
Eg:

``` shell
# download the latest CSV files, then run this command.
# Note, no -f flags needed here.
$ hledger import *.csv [--dry]
```

This method works for most CSV files. (Where records have a stable
chronological order, and new records appear only at the new end.)

A number of other tools and workflows, hledger-specific and otherwise,
exist for converting, deduplicating, classifying and managing CSV data.
See:

-   <https://hledger.org/cookbook.html#setups-and-workflows>
-   <https://plaintextaccounting.org> -\> data import/conversion

#### Setting amounts

Continuing from [amount field](#amount-field) above, here are more tips
on handling various amount-setting situations:

1.  **If the amount is in a single CSV field:**\

    a.  **If its sign indicates direction of flow:**\
        Assign it to `amountN`, to set the Nth posting\'s amount. N is
        usually 1 or 2 but can go up to 99.

    b.  **If another field indicates direction of flow:**\
        Use one or more conditional rules to set the appropriate amount
        sign. Eg:

    ``` rules
    # assume a withdrawal unless Type contains "deposit":
    amount1  -%Amount
    if %Type deposit
      amount1  %Amount
    ```

2.  **If the amount is in one of two CSV fields (eg Debit and
    Credit):**\

    a.  **If both fields are unsigned:**\
        Assign the fields to `amountN-in` and `amountN-out`. This sets
        posting N\'s amount to whichever of these has a non-zero value.
        If it\'s the -out value, the amount will be negated.

    b.  **If either field is signed:**\
        Use a [conditional rule](#if-block) to flip the sign when
        needed. Eg below, the -out value already has a minus sign so we
        undo hledger\'s automatic negating by [negating once
        more](#amount-signs) (but only if the field is non-empty, so
        that we don\'t leave a minus sign by itself):

    ``` rules
    fields date, description, amount1-in, amount1-out
    if %amount1-out [1-9]
     amount1-out -%amount1-out
    ```

    c.  **If both fields can contain a non-zero value (or both can be
        empty):**\
        The -in/-out rules normally choose the value which is
        non-zero/non-empty. Some value pairs can be ambiguous, such as
        `1` and `none`. For such cases, use [conditional
        rules](#if-block) to help select the amount. Eg, to handle the
        above you could select the value containing non-zero digits:

    ``` rules
    fields date, description, in, out
    if %in [1-9]
     amount1 %in
    if %out [1-9]
     amount1 %out
    ```

3.  **If you want posting 2\'s amount converted to cost:**\
    Use the unnumbered `amount` (or `amount-in` and `amount-out`)
    syntax.

4.  **If the CSV has only balance amounts, not transaction amounts:**\
    Assign to `balanceN`, to set a [balance
    assignment](#balance-assignments) on the Nth posting, causing the
    posting\'s amount to be calculated automatically. `balance` with no
    number is equivalent to `balance1`. In this situation hledger is
    more likely to guess the wrong default account name, so you may need
    to set that explicitly.

#### Amount signs

There is some special handling making it easier to parse and to reverse
amount signs. (This only works for whole amounts, not for cost amounts
such as COST in `amount1  AMT @ COST`):

-   **If an amount value begins with a plus sign:**\
    that will be removed: `+AMT` becomes `AMT`

-   **If an amount value is parenthesised:**\
    it will be de-parenthesised and sign-flipped: `(AMT)` becomes `-AMT`

-   **If an amount value has two minus signs (or two sets of
    parentheses, or a minus sign and parentheses):**\
    they cancel out and will be removed: `--AMT` or `-(AMT)` becomes
    `AMT`

-   **If an amount value contains just a sign (or just a set of
    parentheses):**\
    that is removed, making it an empty value. `"+"` or `"-"` or `"()"`
    becomes `""`.

It\'s not possible (without preprocessing the CSV) to set an amount to
its absolute value, ie discard its sign.

#### Setting currency/commodity

If the currency/commodity symbol is included in the CSV\'s amount
field(s):

``` csv
2023-01-01,foo,$123.00
```

you don\'t have to do anything special for the commodity symbol, it will
be assigned as part of the amount. Eg:

``` rules
fields date,description,amount
```

``` journal
2023-01-01 foo
    expenses:unknown         $123.00
    income:unknown          $-123.00
```

If the currency is provided as a separate CSV field:

``` csv
2023-01-01,foo,USD,123.00
```

You can assign that to the `currency` pseudo-field, which has the
special effect of prepending itself to every amount in the transaction
(on the left, with no separating space):

``` rules
fields date,description,currency,amount
```

``` journal
2023-01-01 foo
    expenses:unknown       USD123.00
    income:unknown        USD-123.00
```

Or, you can use a field assignment to construct the amount yourself,
with more control. Eg to put the symbol on the right, and separated by a
space:

``` rules
fields date,description,cur,amt
amount %amt %cur
```

``` journal
2023-01-01 foo
    expenses:unknown        123.00 USD
    income:unknown         -123.00 USD
```

Note we used a temporary field name (`cur`) that is not `currency` -
that would trigger the prepending effect, which we don\'t want here.

#### Amount decimal places

Like amounts in a journal file, the amounts generated by CSV rules like
`amount1` influence [commodity display
styles](#commodity-display-styles), such as the number of decimal places
displayed in reports.

The original amounts as written in the CSV file do not affect display
style (because we don\'t yet reliably know their commodity).

#### Referencing other fields

In field assignments, you can interpolate only CSV fields, not hledger
fields. In the example below, there\'s both a CSV field and a hledger
field named amount1, but %amount1 always means the CSV field, not the
hledger field:

``` rules
# Name the third CSV field "amount1"
fields date,description,amount1

# Set hledger's amount1 to the CSV amount1 field followed by USD
amount1 %amount1 USD

# Set comment to the CSV amount1 (not the amount1 assigned above)
comment %amount1
```

Here, since there\'s no CSV amount1 field, %amount1 will produce a
literal \"amount1\":

``` rules
fields date,description,csvamount
amount1 %csvamount USD
# Can't interpolate amount1 here
comment %amount1
```

When there are multiple field assignments to the same hledger field,
only the last one takes effect. Here, comment\'s value will be be B, or
C if \"something\" is matched, but never A:

``` rules
comment A
comment B
if something
 comment C
```

#### How CSV rules are evaluated

Here\'s how to think of CSV rules being evaluated (if you really need
to). First,

-   `include` - all includes are inlined, from top to bottom, depth
    first. (At each include point the file is inlined and scanned for
    further includes, recursively, before proceeding.)

Then \"global\" rules are evaluated, top to bottom. If a rule is
repeated, the last one wins:

-   `skip` (at top level)
-   `date-format`
-   `newest-first`
-   `fields` - names the CSV fields, optionally sets up initial
    assignments to hledger fields

Then for each CSV record in turn:

-   test all `if` blocks. If any of them contain a `end` rule, skip all
    remaining CSV records. Otherwise if any of them contain a `skip`
    rule, skip that many CSV records. If there are multiple matched
    `skip` rules, the first one wins.
-   collect all field assignments at top level and in matched `if`
    blocks. When there are multiple assignments for a field, keep only
    the last one.
-   compute a value for each hledger field - either the one that was
    assigned to it (and interpolate the %CSVFIELD references), or a
    default
-   generate a hledger transaction (journal entry) from these values.

This is all part of the CSV reader, one of several readers hledger can
use to parse input files. When all files have been read successfully,
the transactions are passed as input to whichever hledger command the
user specified.

<a name="timeclock-format"></a>

#### Well factored rules

Some things than can help reduce duplication and complexity in rules
files:

-   Extracting common rules usable with multiple CSV files into a
    `common.rules`, and adding `include common.rules` to each CSV\'s
    rules file.

-   Splitting if blocks into smaller if blocks, extracting the
    frequently used parts.

### CSV rules examples

#### Bank of Ireland

Here\'s a CSV with two amount fields (Debit and Credit), and a balance
field, which we can use to add balance assertions, which is not
necessary but provides extra error checking:

``` csv
Date,Details,Debit,Credit,Balance
07/12/2012,LODGMENT       529898,,10.0,131.21
07/12/2012,PAYMENT,5,,126
```

``` rules
# bankofireland-checking.csv.rules

# skip the header line
skip

# name the csv fields, and assign some of them as journal entry fields
fields  date, description, amount-out, amount-in, balance

# We generate balance assertions by assigning to "balance"
# above, but you may sometimes need to remove these because:
#
# - the CSV balance differs from the true balance,
#   by up to 0.0000000000005 in my experience
#
# - it is sometimes calculated based on non-chronological ordering,
#   eg when multiple transactions clear on the same day

# date is in UK/Ireland format
date-format  %d/%m/%Y

# set the currency
currency  EUR

# set the base account for all txns
account1  assets:bank:boi:checking
```

``` shell
$ hledger -f bankofireland-checking.csv print
2012-12-07 LODGMENT       529898
    assets:bank:boi:checking         EUR10.0 = EUR131.2
    income:unknown                  EUR-10.0

2012-12-07 PAYMENT
    assets:bank:boi:checking         EUR-5.0 = EUR126.0
    expenses:unknown                  EUR5.0
```

The balance assertions don\'t raise an error above, because we\'re
reading directly from CSV, but they will be checked if these entries are
imported into a journal file.

#### Coinbase

A simple example with some CSV from Coinbase. The spot price is recorded
using cost notation. The legacy `amount` field name conveniently sets
amount 2 (posting 2\'s amount) to the total cost.

``` csv
# Timestamp,Transaction Type,Asset,Quantity Transacted,Spot Price Currency,Spot Price at Transaction,Subtotal,Total (inclusive of fees and/or spread),Fees and/or Spread,Notes
# 2021-12-30T06:57:59Z,Receive,USDC,100,GBP,0.740000,"","","","Received 100.00 USDC from an external account"

#### Amazon

Here we convert amazon.com order history, and use an if block to
generate a third posting if there\'s a fee. (In practice you\'d probably
get this data from your bank instead, but it\'s an example.)

``` csv

## Timeclock

The time logging format of timeclock.el, as read by hledger.

hledger can read time logs in timeclock format. [As with
Ledger](http://ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Time-Keeping), these
are (a subset of)
[timeclock.el](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TimeClock)\'s format,
containing clock-in and clock-out entries as in the example below. The
date is a [simple date](#simple-dates). The time format is
HH:MM\[:SS\]\[+-ZZZZ\]. Seconds and timezone are optional. The timezone,
if present, must be four digits and is ignored (currently the time is
always interpreted as a local time). Lines beginning with `#` or `;` or
`*`, and blank lines, are ignored.

``` timeclock
i 2015/03/30 09:00:00 some account  optional description after 2 spaces ; optional comment, tags:
o 2015/03/30 09:20:00
i 2015/03/31 22:21:45 another:account
o 2015/04/01 02:00:34
```

hledger treats each clock-in/clock-out pair as a transaction posting
some number of hours to an account. Or if the session spans more than
one day, it is split into several transactions, one for each day. For
the above time log, `hledger print` generates these journal entries:

``` shell
$ hledger -f t.timeclock print
2015-03-30 * optional description after 2 spaces   ; optional comment, tags:
    (some account)           0.33h

2015-03-31 * 22:21-23:59
    (another:account)           1.64h

2015-04-01 * 00:00-02:00
    (another:account)           2.01h
```

Here is a
[sample.timeclock](https://raw.github.com/simonmichael/hledger/master/examples/sample.timeclock)
to download and some queries to try:

``` shell
$ hledger -f sample.timeclock balance                               # current time balances
$ hledger -f sample.timeclock register -p 2009/3                    # sessions in march 2009
$ hledger -f sample.timeclock register -p weekly --depth 1 --empty  # time summary by week
```

To generate time logs, ie to clock in and clock out, you could:

-   use emacs and the built-in timeclock.el, or the extended
    [timeclock-x.el](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/timeclock-x.el) and
    perhaps the extras in
    [ledgerutils.el](http://hub.darcs.net/simon/ledgertools/ledgerutils.el)

-   at the command line, use these bash aliases:
    `` shell     alias ti="echo i `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` \$* >>$TIMELOG"     alias to="echo o `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` >>$TIMELOG" ``

-   or use the old `ti` and `to` scripts in the [ledger 2.x
    repository](https://github.com/ledger/ledger/tree/maint/scripts).
    These rely on a \"timeclock\" executable which I think is just the
    ledger 2 executable renamed.

<a name="timedot-format"></a>

## Timedot

`timedot` format is hledger\'s human-friendly time logging format.
Compared to [`timeclock` format](#timeclock), it is

-   convenient for quick, approximate, and retroactive time logging
-   readable: you can see at a glance where time was spent.

A timedot file contains a series of day entries, which might look like
this:

``` timedot
2023-05-01
hom:errands          .... ....  ; two hours
fos:hledger:timedot  ..         ; half an hour
per:admin:finance
```

hledger reads this as a transaction on this day with three (unbalanced)
postings, where each dot represents \"0.25\". No commodity is assumed,
but normally we interpret it as hours, with each dot representing a
quarter-hour. It\'s convenient, though not required, to group the dots
in fours for easy reading.

``` shell
$ hledger -f a.timedot print   # .timedot file extension (or timedot: prefix) is required
2023-05-01 *
    (hom:errands)                    2.00  ; two hours
    (fos:hledger:timedot)            0.50  ; half an hour
    (per:admin:finance)                 0
```

A transaction begins with a non-indented **[simple
date](#simple-dates)** (Y-M-D, Y/M/D, or Y.M.D). It can optionally be
preceded by one or more stars and a space, for Emacs org mode
compatibility. It can optionally be followed on the same line by a
transaction description, and/or a transaction comment following a
semicolon.

After the date line are zero or more time postings, consisting of:

-   an **account name** - any hledger-style [account
    name](#account-names), optionally hierarchical, optionally indented.
-   **two or more spaces** - a field separator, required if there is an
    amount (as in journal format).
-   an optional **timedot amount** - dots representing quarter hours, or
    a number representing hours, optionally with a unit suffix.
-   an optional **posting comment** following a semicolon.

Timedot amounts can be:

-   **dots**: zero or more period characters (`.`), each representing
    0.25. Spaces are ignored and can be used for grouping. Eg: `.... ..`

-   or a **number**. Eg: `1.5`

-   or a **number immediately followed by a unit symbol** `s`, `m`, `h`,
    `d`, `w`, `mo`, or `y`. These are interpreted as seconds, minutes,
    hours, days weeks, months or years, and converted to hours,
    assuming:\
    `60s` = `1m`, `60m` = `1h`, `24h` = `1d`, `7d` = `1w`, `30d` =
    `1mo`, `365d` = `1y`. Eg `90m` is parsed as `1.5`.

There is some added flexibility to help with keeping time log data in
the same file as your notes, todo lists, etc.:

-   Blank lines and lines beginning with `#` or `;` are ignored.

-   Before the first date line, lines beginning with `*` are ignored.

-   From the first date line onward, one or more `*`\'s followed by a
    space at beginning of lines (ie, the headline prefix used by Emacs
    Org mode) is ignored. This means the time log can be kept under an
    Org headline, and date lines or time transaction lines can be Org
    headlines.

-   Lines not ending with a double-space and amount are parsed as
    postings with zero amount. Note hledger\'s register reports hide
    these by default (add -E to see them).

More examples:

``` timedot
# on this day, 6h was spent on client work, 1.5h on haskell FOSS work, etc.
2016/2/1

## PART 3: REPORTING CONCEPTS

## Time periods

<a name="report-period"></a>

### Report start & end date

By default, most hledger reports will show the full span of time
represented by the journal. The report start date will be the earliest
transaction or posting date, and the report end date will be the latest
transaction, posting, or market price date.

Often you will want to see a shorter time span, such as the current
month. You can specify a start and/or end date using
[`-b/--begin`](#reporting-options), [`-e/--end`](#reporting-options),
[`-p/--period`](#period-expressions) or a [`date:` query](#queries)
(described below). All of these accept the [smart date](#smart-dates)
syntax (below).

Some notes:

-   End dates are exclusive, as in Ledger, so you should write the date
    *after* the last day you want to see in the report.
-   As noted in [reporting options](#general-options): among start/end
    dates specified with *options*, the last (i.e. right-most) option
    takes precedence.
-   The effective report start and end dates are the intersection of the
    start/end dates from options and that from `date:` queries. That is,
    `date:2019-01 date:2019 -p'2000 to 2030'` yields January 2019, the
    smallest common time span.
-   In some cases a [report interval](#report-intervals) will adjust
    start/end dates to fall on interval boundaries (see below).

Examples:

|                    |                                                                                             |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `-b 2016/3/17`     | begin on St. Patrick's day 2016                                                             |
| `-e 12/1`          | end at the start of december 1st of the current year (11/30 will be the last date included) |
| `-b thismonth`     | all transactions on or after the 1st of the current month                                   |
| `-p thismonth`     | all transactions in the current month                                                       |
| `date:2016/3/17..` | the above written as queries instead (`..` can also be replaced with `-`)                   |
| `date:..12/1`      |                                                                                             |
| `date:thismonth..` |                                                                                             |
| `date:thismonth`   |                                                                                             |

### Smart dates

hledger\'s user interfaces accept a \"smart date\" syntax for added
convenience. Smart dates optionally can be relative to today\'s date, be
written with english words, and have less-significant parts omitted
(missing parts are inferred as 1). Some examples:

|                                              |                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `2004/10/1`, `2004-01-01`, `2004.9.1`        | exact date, several separators allowed. Year is 4+ digits, month is 1-12, day is 1-31 |
| `2004`                                       | start of year                                                                         |
| `2004/10`                                    | start of month                                                                        |
| `10/1`                                       | month and day in current year                                                         |
| `21`                                         | day in current month                                                                  |
| `october, oct`                               | start of month in current year                                                        |
| `yesterday, today, tomorrow`                 | -1, 0, 1 days from today                                                              |
| `last/this/next day/week/month/quarter/year` | -1, 0, 1 periods from the current period                                              |
| `in n days/weeks/months/quarters/years`      | n periods from the current period                                                     |
| `n days/weeks/months/quarters/years ahead`   | n periods from the current period                                                     |
| `n days/weeks/months/quarters/years ago`     | -n periods from the current period                                                    |
| `20181201`                                   | 8 digit YYYYMMDD with valid year month and day                                        |
| `201812`                                     | 6 digit YYYYMM with valid year and month                                              |

Some counterexamples - malformed digit sequences might give surprising
results:

|             |                                                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `201813`    | 6 digits with an invalid month is parsed as start of 6-digit year |
| `20181301`  | 8 digits with an invalid month is parsed as start of 8-digit year |
| `20181232`  | 8 digits with an invalid day gives an error                       |
| `201801012` | 9+ digits beginning with a valid YYYYMMDD gives an error          |

\"Today\'s date\" can be overridden with the `--today` option, in case
it\'s needed for testing or for recreating old reports. (Except for
periodic transaction rules, which are not affected by `--today`.)

### Report intervals

A report interval can be specified so that reports like
[register](#register), [balance](#balance) or [activity](#activity)
become multi-period, showing each subperiod as a separate row or column.

The following standard intervals can be enabled with command-line flags:

-   `-D/--daily`
-   `-W/--weekly`
-   `-M/--monthly`
-   `-Q/--quarterly`
-   `-Y/--yearly`

More complex intervals can be specified using `-p/--period`, described
below.

### Date adjustment

When there is a report interval (other than daily), report start/end
dates which have been inferred, eg from the journal, are automatically
adjusted to natural period boundaries. This is convenient for producing
simple periodic reports. More precisely:

-   an inferred start date will be adjusted earlier if needed to fall on
    a natural period boundary

-   an inferred end date will be adjusted later if needed to make the
    last period the same length as the others.

By contrast, start/end dates which have been specified explicitly, with
`-b`, `-e`, `-p` or `date:`, will not be adjusted (since hledger 1.29).
This makes it possible to specify non-standard report periods, but it
also means that if you are specifying a start date, you should pick one
that\'s on a period boundary if you want to see simple report period
headings.

### Period expressions

The `-p/--period` option specifies a period expression, which is a
compact way of expressing a start date, end date, and/or report
interval.

Here\'s a period expression with a start and end date (specifying the
first quarter of 2009):

|                                  |
|----------------------------------|
| `-p "from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1"` |

Several keywords like \"from\" and \"to\" are supported for readability;
these are optional. \"to\" can also be written as \"..\" or \"-\". The
spaces are also optional, as long as you don\'t run two dates together.
So the following are equivalent to the above:

|                          |
|--------------------------|
| `-p "2009/1/1 2009/4/1"` |
| `-p2009/1/1to2009/4/1`   |
| `-p2009/1/1..2009/4/1`   |

Dates are [smart dates](#smart-dates), so if the current year is 2009,
these are also equivalent to the above:

|                         |
|-------------------------|
| `-p "1/1 4/1"`          |
| `-p "jan-apr"`          |
| `-p "this year to 4/1"` |

If you specify only one date, the missing start or end date will be the
earliest or latest transaction date in the journal:

|                      |                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `-p "from 2009/1/1"` | everything after january 1, 2009  |
| `-p "since 2009/1"`  | the same, since is a synonym      |
| `-p "from 2009"`     | the same                          |
| `-p "to 2009"`       | everything before january 1, 2009 |

You can also specify a period by writing a single partial or full date:

|                 |                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `-p "2009"`     | the year 2009; equivalent to "2009/1/1 to 2010/1/1"             |
| `-p "2009/1"`   | the month of january 2009; equivalent to "2009/1/1 to 2009/2/1" |
| `-p "2009/1/1"` | the first day of 2009; equivalent to "2009/1/1 to 2009/1/2"     |

or by using the \"Q\" quarter-year syntax (case insensitive):

|               |                                                             |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `-p "2009Q1"` | first quarter of 2009, equivalent to "2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1" |
| `-p "q4"`     | fourth quarter of the current year                          |

#### Period expressions with a report interval

A period expression can also begin with a [report
interval](#report-intervals), separated from the start/end dates (if
any) by a space or the word `in`:

|                                         |
|-----------------------------------------|
| `-p "weekly from 2009/1/1 to 2009/4/1"` |
| `-p "monthly in 2008"`                  |
| `-p "quarterly"`                        |

#### More complex report intervals

Some more complex intervals can be specified within period expressions,
such as:

-   `biweekly` (every two weeks)
-   `fortnightly`
-   `bimonthly` (every two months)
-   `every day|week|month|quarter|year`
-   `every N days|weeks|months|quarters|years`

Weekly on a custom day:

-   `every Nth day of week` (`th`, `nd`, `rd`, or `st` are all accepted
    after the number)
-   `every WEEKDAYNAME` (full or three-letter english weekday name, case
    insensitive)

Monthly on a custom day:

-   `every Nth day [of month]`
-   `every Nth WEEKDAYNAME [of month]`

Yearly on a custom day:

-   `every MM/DD [of year]` (month number and day of month number)
-   `every MONTHNAME DDth [of year]` (full or three-letter english month
    name, case insensitive, and day of month number)
-   `every DDth MONTHNAME [of year]` (equivalent to the above)

Examples:

|                                    |                                                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `-p "bimonthly from 2008"`         |                                                          |
| `-p "every 2 weeks"`               |                                                          |
| `-p "every 5 months from 2009/03"` |                                                          |
| `-p "every 2nd day of week"`       | periods will go from Tue to Tue                          |
| `-p "every Tue"`                   | same                                                     |
| `-p "every 15th day"`              | period boundaries will be on 15th of each month          |
| `-p "every 2nd Monday"`            | period boundaries will be on second Monday of each month |
| `-p "every 11/05"`                 | yearly periods with boundaries on 5th of November        |
| `-p "every 5th November"`          | same                                                     |
| `-p "every Nov 5th"`               | same                                                     |

Show historical balances at end of the 15th day of each month (N is an
end date, exclusive as always):

``` shell
$ hledger balance -H -p "every 16th day"
```

Group postings from the start of wednesday to end of the following
tuesday (N is both (inclusive) start date and (exclusive) end date):

``` shell
$ hledger register checking -p "every 3rd day of week"
```

#### Multiple weekday intervals

This special form is also supported:

-   `every WEEKDAYNAME,WEEKDAYNAME,...` (full or three-letter english
    weekday names, case insensitive)

Also, `weekday` and `weekendday` are shorthand for `mon,tue,wed,thu,fri`
and `sat,sun`.

This is mainly intended for use with `--forecast`, to generate [periodic
transactions](#periodic-transactions) on arbitrary days of the week. It
may be less useful with `-p`, since it divides each week into subperiods
of unequal length, which is unusual. (Related:
[#1632](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/pull/1632))

Examples:

|                          |                                                                                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `-p "every mon,wed,fri"` | dates will be Mon, Wed, Fri; <br>periods will be Mon-Tue, Wed-Thu, Fri-Sun             |
| `-p "every weekday"`     | dates will be Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri; <br>periods will be Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri-Sun |
| `-p "every weekendday"`  | dates will be Sat, Sun; <br>periods will be Sat, Sun-Fri                               |

## Depth

With the `--depth NUM` option (short form: `-NUM`), reports will show
accounts only to the specified depth, hiding deeper subaccounts. Use
this when you want a summary with less detail. This flag has the same
effect as a `depth:` query argument: `depth:2`, `--depth=2` or `-2` are
equivalent.

## Queries

One of hledger\'s strengths is being able to quickly report on a precise
subset of your data. Most hledger commands accept optional query
arguments to restrict their scope. The syntax is as follows:

-   Zero or more space-separated query terms. These are most often
    [account name](#account-names) substrings:

    `utilities food:groceries`

-   Terms with spaces or other [special characters](#special-characters)
    should be enclosed in quotes:

    `"personal care"`

-   [Regular expressions](#regular-expressions) are also supported:

    `"^expenses\b" "accounts (payable|receivable)"`

-   Add a query type prefix to match other parts of the data:

    `date:202312- desc:amazon cur:USD amt:">100" status:`

-   Add a `not:` prefix to negate a term:

    `not:cur:USD`

### Query types

Here are the types of query term available. Remember these can also be
prefixed with **`not:`** to convert them into a negative match.

**`acct:REGEX`, `REGEX`**\
Match account names containing this (case insensitive) [regular
expression](#regular-expressions). This is the default query type when
there is no prefix, and regular expression syntax is typically not
needed, so usually we just write an account name substring, like
`expenses` or `food`.

**`amt:N, amt:<N, amt:<=N, amt:>N, amt:>=N`**\
Match postings with a single-commodity amount equal to, less than, or
greater than N. (Postings with multi-commodity amounts are not tested
and will always match.) The comparison has two modes: if N is preceded
by a + or - sign (or is 0), the two signed numbers are compared.
Otherwise, the absolute magnitudes are compared, ignoring sign.

**`code:REGEX`**\
Match by transaction code (eg check number).

**`cur:REGEX`**\
Match postings or transactions including any amounts whose
currency/commodity symbol is fully matched by REGEX. (For a partial
match, use `.*REGEX.*`). Note, to match [special
characters](#special-characters) which are regex-significant, you need
to escape them with `\`. And for characters which are significant to
your shell you may need one more level of escaping. So eg to match the
dollar sign:\
`hledger print cur:\\$`.

**`desc:REGEX`**\
Match transaction descriptions.

**`date:PERIODEXPR`**\
Match dates (or with the `--date2` flag, [secondary
dates](#secondary-dates)) within the specified period. PERIODEXPR is a
[period expression](#period-expressions) with no report interval.
Examples:\
`date:2016`, `date:thismonth`, `date:2/1-2/15`,
`date:2021-07-27..nextquarter`.

**`date2:PERIODEXPR`**\
Match secondary dates within the specified period (independent of the
`--date2` flag).

**`depth:N`**\
Match (or display, depending on command) accounts at or above this
depth.

**`note:REGEX`**\
Match transaction [notes](#payee-and-note) (the part of the description
right of `|`, or the whole description if there\'s no `|`).

**`payee:REGEX`**\
Match transaction [payee/payer names](#payee-and-note) (the part of the
description left of `|`, or the whole description if there\'s no `|`).

**`real:, real:0`**\
Match real or virtual postings respectively.

**`status:, status:!, status:*`**\
Match unmarked, pending, or cleared transactions respectively.

**`type:TYPECODES`**\
Match by account type (see [Declaring accounts \> Account
types](#account-types)). `TYPECODES` is one or more of the single-letter
account type codes `ALERXCV`, case insensitive. Note `type:A` and
`type:E` will also match their respective subtypes `C` (Cash) and `V`
(Conversion). Certain kinds of account alias can disrupt account types,
see [Rewriting accounts \> Aliases and account
types](#aliases-and-account-types).

**`tag:REGEX[=REGEX]`**\
Match by tag name, and optionally also by tag value. (To match only by
value, use `tag:.=REGEX`.)

When querying by tag, note that:

-   Accounts also inherit the tags of their parent accounts
-   Postings also inherit the tags of their account and their
    transaction
-   Transactions also acquire the tags of their postings.

(**`inacct:ACCTNAME`**\
A special query term used automatically in hledger-web only: tells
hledger-web to show the transaction register for an account.)

### Combining query terms

When given multiple space-separated query terms, most commands select
things which match:

-   any of the description terms AND
-   any of the account terms AND
-   any of the status terms AND
-   all the other terms.

The [print](#print) command is a little different, showing transactions
which:

-   match any of the description terms AND
-   have any postings matching any of the positive account terms AND
-   have no postings matching any of the negative account terms AND
-   match all the other terms.

We also support more complex boolean queries with the \'expr:\' prefix.
This allows one to combine queries using one of three operators: AND,
OR, and NOT, where NOT is different syntax for \'not:\'.

Examples of such queries are:

-   Match transactions with \'cool\' in the description AND with the
    \'A\' tag

    `expr:"desc:cool AND tag:A"`

-   Match transactions NOT to the \'expenses:food\' account OR with the
    \'A\' tag

    `expr:"NOT expenses:food OR tag:A"`

-   Match transactions NOT involving the \'expenses:food\' account OR
    with the \'A\' tag AND involving the \'expenses:drink\' account.
    (the AND is implicitly added by space-separation, following the
    rules above)

    `expr:"expenses:food OR (tag:A expenses:drink)"`

### Queries and command options

Some queries can also be expressed as command-line options: `depth:2` is
equivalent to `--depth 2`, `date:2023` is equivalent to `-p 2023`, etc.
When you mix command options and query arguments, generally the
resulting query is their intersection.

### Queries and valuation

When amounts are converted to other commodities in
[cost](#cost-reporting) or [value](#valuation) reports, `cur:` and
`amt:` match the old commodity symbol and the old amount quantity, not
the new ones (except in hledger 1.22.0 where it\'s reversed, see
[#1625](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1625)).

### Querying with account aliases

When account names are [rewritten](#alias-directive) with `--alias` or
`alias`, note that `acct:` will match either the old or the new account
name.

### Querying with cost or value

When amounts are converted to other commodities in
[cost](#cost-reporting) or [value](#valuation) reports, note that `cur:`
matches the new commodity symbol, and not the old one, and `amt:`
matches the new quantity, and not the old one. Note: this changed in
hledger 1.22, previously it was the reverse, see the discussion at
[#1625](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1625).

## Pivoting

Normally, hledger groups and sums amounts within each account. The
`--pivot FIELD` option substitutes some other transaction field for
account names, causing amounts to be grouped and summed by that field\'s
value instead. FIELD can be any of the transaction fields `status`,
`code`, `description`, `payee`, `note`, or a tag name. When pivoting on
a tag and a posting has multiple values of that tag, only the first
value is displayed. Values containing `colon:separated:parts` will be
displayed hierarchically, like account names.

Some examples:

``` journal
2016/02/16 Yearly Dues Payment
    assets:bank account                 2 EUR
    income:dues                        -2 EUR  ; member: John Doe
```

Normal balance report showing account names:

``` shell
$ hledger balance
               2 EUR  assets:bank account
              -2 EUR  income:dues
--------------------
                   0
```

Pivoted balance report, using member: tag values instead:

``` shell
$ hledger balance --pivot member
               2 EUR
              -2 EUR  John Doe
--------------------
                   0
```

One way to show only amounts with a member: value (using a
[query](#queries)):

``` shell
$ hledger balance --pivot member tag:member=.
              -2 EUR  John Doe
--------------------
              -2 EUR
```

Another way (the acct: query matches against the pivoted \"account
name\"):

``` shell
$ hledger balance --pivot member acct:.
              -2 EUR  John Doe
--------------------
              -2 EUR
```

## Generating data

hledger has several features for generating data, such as:

-   [Periodic transaction](#periodic-transactions) rules can generate
    single or repeating transactions following a template. These are
    usually dated in the future, eg to help with forecasting. They are
    activated by the `--forecast` option.

-   The balance command\'s `--budget` option uses these same periodic
    rules to generate goals for the budget report.

-   [Auto posting](#auto-postings) rules can generate extra postings on
    certain matched transactions. They are always applied to forecast
    transactions; with the `--auto` flag they are applied to
    transactions recorded in the journal as well.

-   The `--infer-equity` flag infers missing conversion equity postings
    from @/@@ costs. And the inverse `--infer-costs` flag infers missing
    @/@@ costs from conversion equity postings.

Generated data of this kind is temporary, existing only at report time.
But you can see it in the output of `hledger print`, and you can save
that to your journal, in effect converting it from temporary generated
data to permanent recorded data. This could be useful as a data entry
aid.

If you are wondering what data is being generated and why, add the
`--verbose-tags` flag. In `hledger print` output you will see extra tags
like `generated-transaction`, `generated-posting`, and `modified` on
generated/modified data. Also, even without `--verbose-tags`, generated
data always has equivalen hidden tags (with an underscore prefix), so eg
you could match generated transactions with
`tag:_generated-transaction`.

## Forecasting

Forecasting, or speculative future reporting, can be useful for
estimating future balances, or for exploring different future scenarios.

The simplest and most flexible way to do it with hledger is to manually
record a bunch of future-dated transactions. You could keep these in a
separate `future.journal` and include that with `-f` only when you want
to see them.

### \--forecast

There is another way: with the `--forecast` option, hledger can generate
temporary \"forecast transactions\" for reporting purposes, according to
[periodic transaction rules](#periodic-transactions) defined in the
journal. Each rule can generate multiple recurring transactions, so by
changing one rule you can change many forecasted transactions. (These
same rules can also generate budget goals, described in
[Budgeting](#budgeting).)

Forecast transactions usually start after ordinary transactions end. By
default, they begin after your latest-dated ordinary transaction, or
today, whichever is later, and they end six months from today. (The
exact rules are a little more complicated, and are given below.)

This is the \"forecast period\", which need not be the same as the
[report period](#report-period). You can override it - eg to forecast
farther into the future, or to force forecast transactions to overlap
your ordinary transactions - by giving the \--forecast option a [period
expression](#period-expressions) argument, like `--forecast=..2099` or
`--forecast=2023-02-15..`. Note that the `=` is required.

### Inspecting forecast transactions

`print` is the best command for inspecting and troubleshooting forecast
transactions. Eg:

``` journal
~ monthly from 2022-12-20    rent
    assets:bank:checking
    expenses:rent           $1000
```

``` terminal
$ hledger print --forecast --today=2023/4/21
2023-05-20 rent
    ; generated-transaction: ~ monthly from 2022-12-20
    assets:bank:checking
    expenses:rent                  $1000

2023-06-20 rent
    ; generated-transaction: ~ monthly from 2022-12-20
    assets:bank:checking
    expenses:rent                  $1000

2023-07-20 rent
    ; generated-transaction: ~ monthly from 2022-12-20
    assets:bank:checking
    expenses:rent                  $1000

2023-08-20 rent
    ; generated-transaction: ~ monthly from 2022-12-20
    assets:bank:checking
    expenses:rent                  $1000

2023-09-20 rent
    ; generated-transaction: ~ monthly from 2022-12-20
    assets:bank:checking
    expenses:rent                  $1000
```

Here there are no ordinary transactions, so the forecasted transactions
begin on the first occurence after today\'s date. (You won\'t normally
use `--today`; it\'s just to make these examples reproducible.)

### Forecast reports

Forecast transactions affect all reports, as you would expect. Eg:

``` terminal
$ hledger areg rent --forecast --today=2023/4/21
Transactions in expenses:rent and subaccounts:
2023-05-20 rent                 as:ba:checking               $1000         $1000
2023-06-20 rent                 as:ba:checking               $1000         $2000
2023-07-20 rent                 as:ba:checking               $1000         $3000
2023-08-20 rent                 as:ba:checking               $1000         $4000
2023-09-20 rent                 as:ba:checking               $1000         $5000
```

``` terminal
$ hledger bal -M expenses --forecast --today=2023/4/21
Balance changes in 2023-05-01..2023-09-30:

               ||   May    Jun    Jul    Aug    Sep 
===============++===================================
 expenses:rent || $1000  $1000  $1000  $1000  $1000 
---------------++-----------------------------------
               || $1000  $1000  $1000  $1000  $1000 
```

### Forecast tags

Forecast transactions generated by \--forecast have a hidden tag,
`_generated-transaction`. So if you ever need to match forecast
transactions, you could use `tag:_generated-transaction` (or just
`tag:generated`) in a query.

For troubleshooting, you can add the `--verbose-tags` flag. Then,
visible `generated-transaction` tags will be added also, so you can view
them with the `print` command. Their value indicates which periodic rule
was responsible.

### Forecast period, in detail

Forecast start/end dates are chosen so as to do something useful by
default in almost all situations, while also being flexible. Here are
(with luck) the exact rules, to help with troubleshooting:

The forecast period starts on:

-   the later of
    -   the start date in the periodic transaction rule
    -   the start date in `--forecast`\'s argument
-   otherwise (if those are not available): the later of
    -   the report start date specified with `-b`/`-p`/`date:`
    -   the day after the latest ordinary transaction in the journal
-   otherwise (if none of these are available): today.

The forecast period ends on:

-   the earlier of
    -   the end date in the periodic transaction rule
    -   the end date in `--forecast`\'s argument
-   otherwise: the report end date specified with `-e`/`-p`/`date:`
-   otherwise: 180 days (\~6 months) from today.

### Forecast troubleshooting

When \--forecast is not doing what you expect, one of these tips should
help:

-   Remember to use the `--forecast` option.
-   Remember to have at least one periodic transaction rule in your
    journal.
-   Test with `print --forecast`.
-   Check for typos or too-restrictive start/end dates in your periodic
    transaction rule.
-   Leave at least 2 spaces between the rule\'s period expression and
    description fields.
-   Check for future-dated ordinary transactions suppressing forecasted
    transactions.
-   Try setting explicit report start and/or end dates with `-b`, `-e`,
    `-p` or `date:`
-   Try adding the `-E` flag to encourage display of empty periods/zero
    transactions.
-   Try setting explicit forecast start and/or end dates with
    `--forecast=START..END`
-   Consult [Forecast period, in detail](#forecast-period-in-detail),
    above.
-   Check inside the engine: add `--debug=2` (eg).

## Budgeting

With the balance command\'s [`--budget` report](#budget-report), each
periodic transaction rule generates recurring budget goals in specified
accounts, and goals and actual performance can be compared. See the
balance command\'s doc below.

You can generate budget goals and forecast transactions at the same
time, from the same or different periodic transaction rules:
`hledger bal -M --budget --forecast ...`

See also: [Budgeting and Forecasting](/budgeting-and-forecasting.html).

## Cost reporting

This section is about recording the cost of things, in transactions
where one commodity is exchanged for another. Eg an exchange of
currency, or a stock purchase or sale. First, a quick glossary:

-   Conversion - an exchange of one currency or commodity for another.
    Eg a foreign currency exchange, or a purchase or sale of stock or
    cryptocurrency.

-   Conversion transaction - a transaction involving one or more
    conversions.

-   Conversion rate - the cost per unit of one commodity in the other,
    ie the exchange rate.

-   Cost - how much of one commodity was paid to acquire the other. And
    more generally, in hledger docs: the amount exchanged in the
    \"secondary\" commodity (usually your base currency), whether in a
    purchase or a sale, and whether expressed per unit or in total.
    Also, the \"@/@@ PRICE\" notation used to represent this.

### -B: Convert to cost

As discussed in [JOURNAL \> Costs](#costs), when recording a transaction
you can also record the amount\'s cost in another commodity, by adding
`@ UNITPRICE` or `@@ TOTALPRICE`.

Then you can see a report with amounts converted to cost, by adding the
[`-B/--cost`](#reporting-options) flag. (Mnemonic: \"B\" from \"cost
Basis\", as in Ledger). Eg:

``` journal
2022-01-01
  assets:dollars  $-135          ; 135 dollars is exchanged for..
  assets:euros     €100 @ $1.35  ; one hundred euros purchased at $1.35 each
```

``` shell
$ hledger bal -N
               $-135  assets:dollars
                €100  assets:euros
$ hledger bal -N -B
               $-135  assets:dollars
                $135  assets:euros    # <- the euros' cost
```

Notes:

-B is sensitive to the order of postings when a cost is inferred: the
inferred price will be in the commodity of the last amount. So if
example 3\'s postings are reversed, while the transaction is equivalent,
-B shows something different:

``` journal
2022-01-01
  assets:dollars  $-135              ; 135 dollars sold
  assets:euros     €100              ; for 100 euros
```

``` shell
$ hledger bal -N -B
               €-100  assets:dollars  # <- the dollars' selling price
                €100  assets:euros
```

The @/@@ cost notation is convenient, but has some drawbacks: it does
not truly balance the transaction, so it disrupts the accounting
equation and tends to causes a non-zero total in balance reports.

### Equity conversion postings

By contrast, conventional double entry bookkeeping (DEB) uses a
different notation: an extra pair of equity postings to balance
conversion transactions. In this style, the above entry might be
written:

``` journal
2022-01-01 one hundred euros purchased at $1.35 each
    assets:dollars      $-135
    equity:conversion    $135
    equity:conversion   €-100
    assets:euros         €100
```

This style is more correct, but it\'s also more verbose and makes cost
reporting more difficult for PTA tools.

Happily, current hledger can read either notation, or convert one to the
other when needed, so you can use the one you prefer.

You can even use cost notation and equivalent conversion postings at the
same time, for clarity. hledger will ignore the redundancy. But be sure
the cost and conversion posting amounts match, or you\'ll see a
not-so-clear transaction balancing error message.

### Inferring equity postings from cost

With `--infer-equity`, hledger detects transactions written with PTA
cost notation and adds equity conversion postings to them:

``` journal
2022-01-01
  assets:dollars  -$135
  assets:euros     €100 @ $1.35
```

``` shell
$ hledger print --infer-equity
2022-01-01
    assets:dollars                    $-135
    assets:euros               €100 @ $1.35
    equity:conversion:$-€:€           €-100  ; generated-posting:
    equity:conversion:$-€:$         $135.00  ; generated-posting:
```

The conversion account names can be changed with the [conversion account
type declaration](#account-types).

\--infer-equity is useful when when transactions have been recorded
using cost notation, to help preserve the accounting equation and
balance reports\' zero total, or to produce more conventional journal
entries for sharing with non-PTA-users.

### Inferring cost from equity postings

The reverse operation is possible using `--infer-costs`, which detects
transactions written with equity conversion postings and adds cost
notation to them:

``` journal
2022-01-01
    assets:dollars            $-135
    equity:conversion          $135
    equity:conversion         €-100
    assets:euros               €100
```

``` shell
$ hledger print --infer-costs
2022-01-01
    assets:dollars       $-135 @@ €100
    equity:conversion             $135
    equity:conversion            €-100
    assets:euros                  €100
```

\--infer-costs is useful when combined with -B/\--cost, allowing cost
reporting even when transactions have been recorded using equity
postings:

``` shell
$ hledger print --infer-costs -B
2009-01-01
    assets:dollars           €-100
    assets:euros              €100
```

Notes:

For `--infer-costs` to work, an exchange must consist of four postings:

1.  two non-equity postings
2.  two equity postings, next to one another
3.  the equity accounts must be declared, with account type
    `V`/`Conversion` (or if they are not declared, they must be named
    `equity:conversion`, `equity:trade`, `equity:trading` or subaccounts
    of these)
4.  the equity postings\' amounts must exactly match the non-equity
    postings\' amounts.

Multiple such exchanges can coexist within a single transaction.

When inferring cost, the order of postings matters: the cost is added to
the first of the non-equity postings involved in the exchange, in the
commodity of the last non-equity posting involved in the exchange. If
you don\'t want to write your postings in the required order, you can
use explicit cost notation instead.

\--infer-equity and \--infer-costs can be used together, if you have a
mixture of both notations in your journal.

### When to infer cost/equity

Inferring equity postings or costs is still fairly new, so not enabled
by default. We\'re not sure yet if that should change. Here are two
suggestions to try, experience reports welcome:

1.  When you use -B, always use \--infer-costs as well. Eg:
    `hledger bal -B --infer-costs`

2.  Always run hledger with both flags enabled. Eg:
    `alias hl="hledger --infer-equity --infer-costs"`

### How to record conversions

Essentially there are four ways to record a conversion transaction in
hledger. Here are all of them, with pros and cons.

#### Conversion with implicit cost

Let\'s assume 100 EUR is converted to 120 USD. You can just record the
outflow (100 EUR) and inflow (120 USD) in the appropriate asset account:

``` journal
2021-01-01
    assets:cash    -100 EUR
    assets:cash     120 USD
```

hledger will assume this transaction is balanced, inferring that the
conversion rate must be 1 EUR = 1.20 USD. You can see the inferred rate
by using `hledger print -x`.

Pro:

-   Concise, easy

Con:

-   Less error checking - typos in amounts or commodity symbols may not
    be detected
-   Conversion rate is not clear
-   Disturbs the accounting equation, unless you add the \--infer-equity
    flag

You can prevent accidental implicit conversions due to a mistyped
commodity symbol, by using `hledger check commodities`.

You can prevent implicit conversions entirely, by using
`hledger check balancednoautoconversion`, or `-s/--strict`.

#### Conversion with explicit cost

You can add the conversion rate using @ notation:

``` journal
2021-01-01
    assets:cash        -100 EUR @ 1.20 USD
    assets:cash         120 USD
```

Now hledger will check that 100 \* 1.20 = 120, and would report an error
otherwise.

Pro:

-   Still concise
-   Makes the conversion rate clear
-   Provides more error checking

Con:

-   Disturbs the accounting equation, unless you add the \--infer-equity
    flag

#### Conversion with equity postings

In strict double entry bookkeeping, the above transaction is not
balanced in EUR or in USD, since some EUR disappears, and some USD
appears. This violates the accounting equation (A+L+E=0), and prevents
reports like `balancesheetequity` from showing a zero total.

The proper way to make it balance is to add a balancing posting for each
commodity, using an equity account:

``` journal
2021-01-01
    assets:cash        -100 EUR
    equity:conversion   100 EUR
    equity:conversion  -120 USD
    assets:cash         120 USD
```

Pro:

-   Preserves the accounting equation
-   Keeps track of conversions and related gains/losses in one place
-   Standard, works in any double entry accounting system

Con:

-   More verbose
-   Conversion rate is not obvious
-   Cost reporting requires adding the \--infer-costs flag

#### Conversion with equity postings and explicit cost

Here both equity postings and @ notation are used together.

``` journal
2021-01-01
    assets:cash        -100 EUR @ 1.20 USD
    equity:conversion   100 EUR
    equity:conversion  -120 USD
    assets:cash         120 USD
```

Pro:

-   Preserves the accounting equation
-   Keeps track of conversions and related gains/losses in one place
-   Makes the conversion rate clear
-   Provides more error checking

Con:

-   Most verbose
-   Not compatible with ledger

### Cost tips

-   Recording the cost/conversion rate explicitly is good because it
    makes that clear and helps detect errors.
-   Recording equity postings is good because it is correct bookkeeping
    and preserves the accounting equation.
-   Combining these is possible.
-   When you want to see the cost (or sale proceeds) of things, use `-B`
    (short form of `--cost`).
-   If you use conversion postings without cost notation, add
    `--infer-costs` also.
-   If you use cost notation without conversion postings, and you want
    to see a balanced balance sheet or print correct journal entries,
    use `--infer-equity`.
-   Conversion to cost is performed before valuation (described next).

## Valuation

Instead of reporting amounts in their original commodity, hledger can
convert them to cost/sale amount (using the conversion rate recorded in
the transaction), and/or to market value (using some market price on a
certain date). This is controlled by the `--value=TYPE[,COMMODITY]`
option, which will be described below. We also provide the simpler `-V`
and `-X COMMODITY` options, and often one of these is all you need:

### -V: Value

The `-V/--market` flag converts amounts to market value in their default
*valuation commodity*, using the [market prices](#p-directive) in effect
on the *valuation date(s)*, if any. More on these in a minute.

### -X: Value in specified commodity

The `-X/--exchange=COMM` option is like `-V`, except you tell it which
currency you want to convert to, and it tries to convert everything to
that.

### Valuation date

Since market prices can change from day to day, market value reports
have a valuation date (or more than one), which determines which market
prices will be used.

For single period reports, if an explicit [report end
date](#report-start-end-date) is specified, that will be used as the
valuation date; otherwise the valuation date is the journal\'s end date.

For [multiperiod reports](#report-intervals), each column/period is
valued on the last day of the period, by default.

### Finding market price

To convert a commodity A to its market value in another commodity B,
hledger looks for a suitable market price (exchange rate) as follows, in
this order of preference :

1.  A *declared market price* or *inferred market price*: A\'s latest
    market price in B on or before the valuation date as declared by a
    [P directive](#p-directive), or (with the `--infer-market-prices`
    flag) inferred from [costs](#costs).

2.  A *reverse market price*: the inverse of a declared or inferred
    market price from B to A.

3.  A *forward chain of market prices*: a synthetic price formed by
    combining the shortest chain of \"forward\" (only 1 above) market
    prices, leading from A to B.

4.  *Any chain of market prices*: a chain of any market prices,
    including both forward and reverse prices (1 and 2 above), leading
    from A to B.

There is a limit to the length of these price chains; if hledger reaches
that length without finding a complete chain or exhausting all
possibilities, it will give up (with a \"gave up\" message visible in
`--debug=2` output). That limit is currently 1000.

Amounts for which no suitable market price can be found, are not
converted.

### \--infer-market-prices: market prices from transactions

Normally, market value in hledger is fully controlled by, and requires,
[P directives](#p-directive) in your journal. Since adding and updating
those can be a chore, and since transactions usually take place at close
to market value, why not use the recorded [costs](#costs) as additional
market prices (as Ledger does) ? Adding the `--infer-market-prices` flag
to `-V`, `-X` or `--value` enables this.

So for example, `hledger bs -V --infer-market-prices` will get market
prices both from P directives and from transactions. If both occur on
the same day, the P directive takes precedence.

There is a downside: value reports can sometimes be affected in
confusing/undesired ways by your journal entries. If this happens to
you, read all of this [Valuation](#valuation) section carefully, and try
adding `--debug` or `--debug=2` to troubleshoot.

`--infer-market-prices` can infer market prices from:

-   multicommodity transactions with explicit prices (`@`/`@@`)

-   multicommodity transactions with implicit prices (no `@`, two
    commodities, unbalanced). (With these, the order of postings
    matters. `hledger print -x` can be useful for troubleshooting.)

-   [multicommodity transactions with equity
    postings](#conversion-with-equity-postings), if cost is inferred
    with [`--infer-costs`](#inferring-cost-from-equity-postings).

There is a limitation (bug) currently: when a valuation commodity is not
specified, prices inferred with `--infer-market-prices` do not help
select a default valuation commodity, as `P` prices would. So conversion
might not happen because no valuation commodity was detected
(`--debug=2` will show this). To be safe, specify the valuation
commmodity, eg:

-   `-X EUR --infer-market-prices`, not `-V --infer-market-prices`
-   `--value=then,EUR --infer-market-prices`, not
    `--value=then --infer-market-prices`

Signed costs and market prices can be confusing. For reference, here is
the current behaviour, since hledger 1.25. (If you think it should work
differently, see
[#1870](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1870).)

### Valuation commodity

**When you specify a valuation commodity (`-X COMM` or
`--value TYPE,COMM`):**\
hledger will convert all amounts to COMM, wherever it can find a
suitable market price (including by reversing or chaining prices).

**When you leave the valuation commodity unspecified (`-V` or
`--value TYPE`):**\
For each commodity A, hledger picks a default valuation commodity as
follows, in this order of preference:

1.  The price commodity from the latest P-declared market price for A on
    or before valuation date.

2.  The price commodity from the latest P-declared market price for A on
    any date. (Allows conversion to proceed when there are inferred
    prices before the valuation date.)

3.  If there are no P directives at all (any commodity or date) and the
    `--infer-market-prices` flag is used: the price commodity from the
    latest transaction-inferred price for A on or before valuation date.

This means:

-   If you have [P directives](#p-directive), they determine which
    commodities `-V` will convert, and to what.

-   If you have no P directives, and use the `--infer-market-prices`
    flag, [costs](#costs) determine it.

Amounts for which no valuation commodity can be found are not converted.

### Simple valuation examples

Here are some quick examples of `-V`:

``` journal
; one euro is worth this many dollars from nov 1
P 2016/11/01 € $1.10

; purchase some euros on nov 3
2016/11/3
    assets:euros        €100
    assets:checking

; the euro is worth fewer dollars by dec 21
P 2016/12/21 € $1.03
```

How many euros do I have ?

``` shell
$ hledger -f t.j bal -N euros
                €100  assets:euros
```

What are they worth at end of nov 3 ?

``` shell
$ hledger -f t.j bal -N euros -V -e 2016/11/4
             $110.00  assets:euros
```

What are they worth after 2016/12/21 ? (no report end date specified,
defaults to today)

``` shell
$ hledger -f t.j bal -N euros -V
             $103.00  assets:euros
```

### \--value: Flexible valuation

`-V` and `-X` are special cases of the more general `--value` option:

     --value=TYPE[,COMM]  TYPE is then, end, now or YYYY-MM-DD.
                          COMM is an optional commodity symbol.
                          Shows amounts converted to:
                          - default valuation commodity (or COMM) using market prices at posting dates
                          - default valuation commodity (or COMM) using market prices at period end(s)
                          - default valuation commodity (or COMM) using current market prices
                          - default valuation commodity (or COMM) using market prices at some date

The TYPE part selects cost or value and valuation date:

`--value=then`
:   Convert amounts to their value in the [default valuation
    commodity](#valuation-commodity), using market prices on each
    posting\'s date.

`--value=end`
:   Convert amounts to their value in the default valuation commodity,
    using market prices on the last day of the report period (or if
    unspecified, the journal\'s end date); or in multiperiod reports,
    market prices on the last day of each subperiod.

`--value=now`
:   Convert amounts to their value in the default valuation commodity
    using current market prices (as of when report is generated).

`--value=YYYY-MM-DD`
:   Convert amounts to their value in the default valuation commodity
    using market prices on this date.

To select a different valuation commodity, add the optional `,COMM`
part: a comma, then the target commodity\'s symbol. Eg:
**`--value=now,EUR`**. hledger will do its best to convert amounts to
this commodity, deducing [market prices](#p-directive) as described
above.

### More valuation examples

Here are some examples showing the effect of `--value`, as seen with
`print`:

``` journal
P 2000-01-01 A  1 B
P 2000-02-01 A  2 B
P 2000-03-01 A  3 B
P 2000-04-01 A  4 B

2000-01-01
  (a)      1 A @ 5 B

2000-02-01
  (a)      1 A @ 6 B

2000-03-01
  (a)      1 A @ 7 B
```

Show the cost of each posting:

``` shell
$ hledger -f- print --cost
2000-01-01
    (a)             5 B

2000-02-01
    (a)             6 B

2000-03-01
    (a)             7 B
```

Show the value as of the last day of the report period (2000-02-29):

``` shell
$ hledger -f- print --value=end date:2000/01-2000/03
2000-01-01
    (a)             2 B

2000-02-01
    (a)             2 B
```

With no report period specified, that shows the value as of the last day
of the journal (2000-03-01):

``` shell
$ hledger -f- print --value=end
2000-01-01
    (a)             3 B

2000-02-01
    (a)             3 B

2000-03-01
    (a)             3 B
```

Show the current value (the 2000-04-01 price is still in effect today):

``` shell
$ hledger -f- print --value=now
2000-01-01
    (a)             4 B

2000-02-01
    (a)             4 B

2000-03-01
    (a)             4 B
```

Show the value on 2000/01/15:

``` shell
$ hledger -f- print --value=2000-01-15
2000-01-01
    (a)             1 B

2000-02-01
    (a)             1 B

2000-03-01
    (a)             1 B
```

You may need to explicitly set a commodity\'s display style, when
reverse prices are used. Eg this output might be surprising:

``` journal
P 2000-01-01 A 2B

2000-01-01
  a  1B
  b
```

``` shell
$ hledger print -x -X A
2000-01-01
    a               0
    b               0
```

Explanation: because there\'s no amount or commodity directive
specifying a display style for A, 0.5A gets the default style, which
shows no decimal digits. Because the displayed amount looks like zero,
the commodity symbol and minus sign are not displayed either. Adding a
commodity directive sets a more useful display style for A:

``` journal
P 2000-01-01 A 2B
commodity 0.00A

2000-01-01
  a  1B
  b
```

``` shell
$ hledger print -X A
2000-01-01
    a           0.50A
    b          -0.50A
```

### Interaction of valuation and queries

When matching postings based on queries in the presence of valuation,
the following happens.

1.  The query is separated into two parts:
    1.  the currency (`cur:`) or amount (`amt:`).
    2.  all other parts.
2.  The postings are matched to the currency and amount queries based on
    pre-valued amounts.
3.  Valuation is applied to the postings.
4.  The postings are matched to the other parts of the query based on
    post-valued amounts.

### Effect of valuation on reports

Here is a reference for how valuation is supposed to affect each part of
hledger\'s reports (and a glossary). (It\'s wide, you\'ll have to scroll
sideways.) It may be useful when troubleshooting. If you find problems,
please report them, ideally with a reproducible example. Related:

`--cumulative` is omitted to save space, it works like `-H` but with a
zero starting balance.

these are installed by the [hledger-install
script](https://hledger.org/install.html#build-methods). If installed,
they will appear in hledger\'s commands list:

-   [ui](hledger-ui.html) - run hledger\'s terminal UI

    check-fancyassertions, edit, fifo, git, move, pijul, plot, and
    more..

Next, each command is described in detail, in alphabetical order.

### accounts

Show account names.

This command lists account names. By default it shows all known
accounts, either used in transactions or declared with account
directives.

With query arguments, only matched account names and account names
referenced by matched postings are shown.

Or it can show just the used accounts (`--used`/`-u`), the declared
accounts (`--declared`/`-d`), the accounts declared but not used
(`--unused`), the accounts used but not declared (`--undeclared`), or
the first account matched by an account name pattern, if any (`--find`).

It shows a flat list by default. With `--tree`, it uses indentation to
show the account hierarchy. In flat mode you can add `--drop N` to omit
the first few account name components. Account names can be
depth-clipped with `depth:N` or `--depth N` or `-N`.

With `--types`, it also shows each account\'s type, if it\'s known. (See
Declaring accounts \> Account types.)

With `--positions`, it also shows the file and line number of each
account\'s declaration, if any, and the account\'s overall declaration
order; these may be useful when troubleshooting account display order.

With `--directives`, it adds the `account` keyword, showing valid
account directives which can be pasted into a journal file. This is
useful together with `--undeclared` when updating your account
declarations to satisfy `hledger check accounts`.

The `--find` flag can be used to look up a single account name, in the
same way that the `aregister` command does. It returns the
alphanumerically-first matched account name, or if none can be found, it
fails with a non-zero exit code.

Examples:

``` shell
$ hledger accounts
assets:bank:checking
assets:bank:saving
assets:cash
expenses:food
expenses:supplies
income:gifts
income:salary
liabilities:debts
```

``` shell
$ hledger accounts --undeclared --directives >> $LEDGER_FILE
$ hledger check accounts
```

### activity

Show an ascii barchart of posting counts per interval.

The activity command displays an ascii histogram showing transaction
counts by day, week, month or other reporting interval (by day is the
default). With query arguments, it counts only matched transactions.

Examples:

``` shell
$ hledger activity --quarterly
2008-01-01 **
2008-04-01 *******
2008-07-01 
2008-10-01 **
```

### add

Prompt for transactions and add them to the journal. Any arguments will
be used as default inputs for the first N prompts.

Many hledger users edit their journals directly with a text editor, or
generate them from CSV. For more interactive data entry, there is the
`add` command, which prompts interactively on the console for new
transactions, and appends them to the main journal file (which should be
in journal format). Existing transactions are not changed. This is one
of the few hledger commands that writes to the journal file (see also
`import`).

To use it, just run `hledger add` and follow the prompts. You can add as
many transactions as you like; when you are finished, enter `.` or press
control-d or control-c to exit.

Features:

-   add tries to provide useful defaults, using the most similar (by
    description) recent transaction (filtered by the query, if any) as a
    template.
-   You can also set the initial defaults with command line arguments.
-   [Readline-style edit
    keys](http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rluserman.html#SEC3)
    can be used during data entry.
-   The tab key will auto-complete whenever possible - accounts,
    payees/descriptions, dates (`yesterday`, `today`, `tomorrow`). If
    the input area is empty, it will insert the default value.
-   If the journal defines a [default commodity](#default-commodity), it
    will be added to any bare numbers entered.
-   A parenthesised transaction [code](#entries) may be entered
    following a date.
-   [Comments](#transaction-comments) and tags may be entered following
    a description or amount.
-   If you make a mistake, enter `<` at any prompt to go one step
    backward.
-   Input prompts are displayed in a different colour when the terminal
    supports it.

Example (see https://hledger.org/add.html for a detailed tutorial):

``` shell
$ hledger add
Adding transactions to journal file /src/hledger/examples/sample.journal
Any command line arguments will be used as defaults.
Use tab key to complete, readline keys to edit, enter to accept defaults.
An optional (CODE) may follow transaction dates.
An optional ; COMMENT may follow descriptions or amounts.
If you make a mistake, enter < at any prompt to go one step backward.
To end a transaction, enter . when prompted.
To quit, enter . at a date prompt or press control-d or control-c.
Date [2015/05/22]: 
Description: supermarket
Account 1: expenses:food
Amount  1: $10
Account 2: assets:checking
Amount  2 [$-10.0]: 
Account 3 (or . or enter to finish this transaction): .
2015/05/22 supermarket
    expenses:food             $10
    assets:checking        $-10.0

Save this transaction to the journal ? [y]: 
Saved.
Starting the next transaction (. or ctrl-D/ctrl-C to quit)
Date [2015/05/22]: <CTRL-D> $
```

On Microsoft Windows, the add command makes sure that no part of the
file path ends with a period, as that would cause problems
([#1056](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1056)).

### aregister

(areg)

Show the transactions and running historical balance of a single
account, with each transaction displayed as one line.

`aregister` shows the overall transactions affecting a particular
account (and any subaccounts). Each report line represents one
transaction in this account. Transactions before the report start date
are always included in the running balance (`--historical` mode is
always on).

This is a more \"real world\", bank-like view than the
[`register`](#register) command (which shows individual postings,
possibly from multiple accounts, not necessarily in historical mode). As
a quick rule of thumb: - use `aregister` for reviewing and reconciling
real-world asset/liability accounts - use `register` for reviewing
detailed revenues/expenses.

`aregister` requires one argument: the account to report on. You can
write either the full account name, or a case-insensitive regular
expression which will select the alphabetically first matched account.

When there are multiple matches, the alphabetically-first choice can be
surprising; eg if you have `assets:per:checking 1` and
`assets:biz:checking 2` accounts, `hledger areg checking` would select
`assets:biz:checking 2`. It\'s just a convenience to save typing, so if
in doubt, write the full account name, or a distinctive substring that
matches uniquely.

Transactions involving subaccounts of this account will also be shown.
`aregister` ignores depth limits, so its final total will always match a
balance report with similar arguments.

Any additional arguments form a [query](#queries) which will filter the
transactions shown. Note some queries will disturb the running balance,
causing it to be different from the account\'s real-world running
balance.

An example: this shows the transactions and historical running balance
during july, in the first account whose name contains \"checking\":

``` shell
$ hledger areg checking date:jul
```

Each `aregister` line item shows:

-   the transaction\'s date (or the relevant posting\'s date if
    different, see below)
-   the names of all the other account(s) involved in this transaction
    (probably abbreviated)
-   the total change to this account\'s balance from this transaction
-   the account\'s historical running balance after this transaction.

Transactions making a net change of zero are not shown by default; add
the `-E/--empty` flag to show them.

For performance reasons, column widths are chosen based on the first
1000 lines; this means unusually wide values in later lines can cause
visual discontinuities as column widths are adjusted. If you want to
ensure perfect alignment, at the cost of more time and memory, use the
`--align-all` flag.

This command also supports the [output
destination](hledger.html#output-destination) and [output
format](hledger.html#output-format) options. The output formats
supported are `txt`, `csv`, and `json`.

#### aregister and custom posting dates

Transactions whose date is outside the report period can still be shown,
if they have a posting to this account dated inside the report period.
(And in this case it\'s the posting date that is shown.) This ensures
that `aregister` can show an accurate historical running balance,
matching the one shown by `register -H` with the same arguments.

To filter strictly by transaction date instead, add the `--txn-dates`
flag. If you use this flag and some of your postings have custom dates,
it\'s probably best to assume the running balance is wrong.

### balance

(bal)

Show accounts and their balances.

`balance` is one of hledger\'s oldest and most versatile commands, for
listing account balances, balance changes, values, value changes and
more, during one time period or many. Generally it shows a table, with
rows representing accounts, and columns representing periods.

Note there are some higher-level variants of the `balance` command with
convenient defaults, which can be simpler to use:
[`balancesheet`](#balancesheet),
[`balancesheetequity`](#balancesheetequity), [`cashflow`](#cashflow) and
[`incomestatement`](#incomestatement). When you need more control, then
use `balance`.

#### balance features

Here\'s a quick overview of the `balance` command\'s features, followed
by more detailed descriptions and examples. Many of these work with the
higher-level commands as well.

`balance` can show..

-   accounts as a [list (`-l`) or a tree (`-t`)](#list-or-tree-mode)
-   optionally depth-limited ([`-[1-9]`](#depth-limiting))
-   sorted [by declaration order and name](#simple-balance-report), or
    [by amount](#sorting-by-amount)

..and their..

-   balance changes (the default)
-   or actual and planned balance changes ([`--budget`](#budget-report))
-   or value of balance changes ([`-V`](#valuation-type))
-   or change of balance values
    ([`--valuechange`](#balance-report-types))
-   or unrealised capital gain/loss ([`--gain`](#balance-report-types))
-   or postings count ([`--count`](#balance-report-types))

..in..

-   one time period (the whole journal period by default)
-   or multiple periods ([`-D`, `-W`, `-M`, `-Q`, `-Y`,
    `-p INTERVAL`](#report-intervals))

..either..

-   per period (the default)
-   or accumulated since report start date
    ([`--cumulative`](#accumulation-type))
-   or accumulated since account creation
    ([`--historical/-H`](#accumulation-type))

..possibly converted to..

-   cost ([`--value=cost[,COMM]`/`--cost`/`-B`](#valuation-type))
-   or market value, as of transaction dates
    ([`--value=then[,COMM]`](#valuation-type))
-   or at period ends ([`--value=end[,COMM]`](#valuation-type))
-   or now ([`--value=now`](#valuation-type))
-   or at some other date ([`--value=YYYY-MM-DD`](#valuation-type))

..with..

-   totals ([`-T`](#multi-period-balance-report)), averages
    ([`-A`](#multi-period-balance-report)), percentages
    ([`-%`](#percentages)), inverted sign
    ([`--invert`](#sorting-by-amount))
-   rows and columns swapped
    ([`--transpose`](#multi-period-balance-report))
-   another field used as account name
    ([`--pivot`](#multi-period-balance-report))
-   custom-formatted line items (single-period reports only)
    ([`--format`](#balance-report-line-format))
-   commodities displayed on the same line or multiple lines
    ([`--layout`](#commodity-layout))

This command supports the [output destination](#output-destination) and
[output format](#output-format) options, with output formats `txt`,
`csv`, `json`, and (multi-period reports only:) `html`. In `txt` output
in a colour-supporting terminal, negative amounts are shown in red.

The `--related`/`-r` flag shows the balance of the *other* postings in
the transactions of the postings which would normally be shown.

#### Simple balance report

With no arguments, `balance` shows a list of all accounts and their
change of balance - ie, the sum of posting amounts, both inflows and
outflows - during the entire period of the journal. (\"Simple\" here
means just one column of numbers, covering a single period. You can also
have multi-period reports, described later.)

For real-world accounts, these numbers will normally be their end
balance at the end of the journal period; more on this below.

Accounts are sorted by [declaration order](#account) if any, and then
alphabetically by account name. For instance (using
[examples/sample.journal](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/blob/master/examples/sample.journal)):

``` shell
$ hledger -f examples/sample.journal bal
                  $1  assets:bank:saving
                 $-2  assets:cash
                  $1  expenses:food
                  $1  expenses:supplies
                 $-1  income:gifts
                 $-1  income:salary
                  $1  liabilities:debts
--------------------
                   0  
```

Accounts with a zero balance (and no non-zero subaccounts, in tree
mode - see below) are hidden by default. Use `-E/--empty` to show them
(revealing `assets:bank:checking` here):

``` shell
$ hledger -f examples/sample.journal bal  -E
                   0  assets:bank:checking
                  $1  assets:bank:saving
                 $-2  assets:cash
                  $1  expenses:food
                  $1  expenses:supplies
                 $-1  income:gifts
                 $-1  income:salary
                  $1  liabilities:debts
--------------------
                   0  
```

The total of the amounts displayed is shown as the last line, unless
`-N`/`--no-total` is used.

#### Balance report line format

For single-period balance reports displayed in the terminal (only), you
can use `--format FMT` to customise the format and content of each line.
Eg:

``` shell
$ hledger -f examples/sample.journal balance --format "%20(account) %12(total)"
              assets          $-1
         bank:saving           $1
                cash          $-2
            expenses           $2
                food           $1
            supplies           $1
              income          $-2
               gifts          $-1
              salary          $-1
   liabilities:debts           $1
---------------------------------
                                0
```

The FMT format string specifies the formatting applied to each
account/balance pair. It may contain any suitable text, with data fields
interpolated like so:

`%[MIN][.MAX](FIELDNAME)`

-   MIN pads with spaces to at least this width (optional)

-   MAX truncates at this width (optional)

-   FIELDNAME must be enclosed in parentheses, and can be one of:

    -   `depth_spacer` - a number of spaces equal to the account\'s
        depth, or if MIN is specified, MIN \* depth spaces.
    -   `account` - the account\'s name
    -   `total` - the account\'s balance/posted total, right justified

Also, FMT can begin with an optional prefix to control how
multi-commodity amounts are rendered:

-   `%_` - render on multiple lines, bottom-aligned (the default)
-   `%^` - render on multiple lines, top-aligned
-   `%,` - render on one line, comma-separated

There are some quirks. Eg in one-line mode, `%(depth_spacer)` has no
effect, instead `%(account)` has indentation built in. Experimentation
may be needed to get pleasing results.

Some example formats:

-   `%(total)` - the account\'s total
-   `%-20.20(account)` - the account\'s name, left justified, padded to
    20 characters and clipped at 20 characters
-   `%,%-50(account)  %25(total)` - account name padded to 50
    characters, total padded to 20 characters, with multiple commodities
    rendered on one line
-   `%20(total)  %2(depth_spacer)%-(account)` - the default format for
    the single-column balance report

#### Filtered balance report

You can show fewer accounts, a different time period, totals from
cleared transactions only, etc. by using [query](#queries) arguments or
[options](#report-start--end-date) to limit the postings being matched.
Eg:

``` shell
$ hledger -f examples/sample.journal bal --cleared assets date:200806
                 $-2  assets:cash
--------------------
                 $-2  
```

#### List or tree mode

By default, or with `-l/--flat`, accounts are shown as a flat list with
their full names visible, as in the examples above.

With `-t/--tree`, the account hierarchy is shown, with subaccounts\'
\"leaf\" names indented below their parent:

``` shell
$ hledger -f examples/sample.journal balance
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
                  $2  expenses
                  $1    food
                  $1    supplies
                 $-2  income
                 $-1    gifts
                 $-1    salary
                  $1  liabilities:debts
--------------------
                   0
```

Notes:

-   \"Boring\" accounts are combined with their subaccount for more
    compact output, unless `--no-elide` is used. Boring accounts have no
    balance of their own and just one subaccount (eg `assets:bank` and
    `liabilities` above).

-   All balances shown are \"inclusive\", ie including the balances from
    all subaccounts. Note this means some repetition in the output,
    which requires explanation when sharing reports with
    non-plaintextaccounting-users. A tree mode report\'s final total is
    the sum of the top-level balances shown, not of all the balances
    shown.

-   Each group of sibling accounts (ie, under a common parent) is sorted
    separately.

#### Depth limiting

With a `depth:NUM` query, or `--depth NUM` option, or just `-NUM` (eg:
`-3`) balance reports will show accounts only to the specified depth,
hiding the deeper subaccounts. This can be useful for getting an
overview without too much detail.

Account balances at the depth limit always include the balances from any
deeper subaccounts (even in list mode). Eg, limiting to depth 1:

``` shell
$ hledger -f examples/sample.journal balance -1
                 $-1  assets
                  $2  expenses
                 $-2  income
                  $1  liabilities
--------------------
                   0  
```

#### Dropping top-level accounts

You can also hide one or more top-level account name parts, using
`--drop NUM`. This can be useful for hiding repetitive top-level account
names:

``` shell
$ hledger -f examples/sample.journal bal expenses --drop 1
                  $1  food
                  $1  supplies
--------------------
                  $2  
```

<a name="multicolumn-balance-report"></a>

#### Showing declared accounts

With `--declared`, accounts which have been declared with an [account
directive](#account) will be included in the balance report, even if
they have no transactions. (Since they will have a zero balance, you
will also need `-E/--empty` to see them.)

More precisely, *leaf* declared accounts (with no subaccounts) will be
included, since those are usually the more useful in reports.

The idea of this is to be able to see a useful \"complete\" balance
report, even when you don\'t have transactions in all of your declared
accounts yet.

#### Sorting by amount

With `-S/--sort-amount`, accounts with the largest (most positive)
balances are shown first. Eg: `hledger bal expenses -MAS` shows your
biggest averaged monthly expenses first. When more than one commodity is
present, they will be sorted by the alphabetically earliest commodity
first, and then by subsequent commodities (if an amount is missing a
commodity, it is treated as 0).

Revenues and liability balances are typically negative, however, so `-S`
shows these in reverse order. To work around this, you can add
`--invert` to flip the signs. (Or, use one of the higher-level reports,
which flip the sign automatically. Eg: `hledger incomestatement -MAS`).

<a name="tree-mode"></a>

#### Percentages

With `-%/--percent`, balance reports show each account\'s value
expressed as a percentage of the (column) total.

Note it is not useful to calculate percentages if the amounts in a
column have mixed signs. In this case, make a separate report for each
sign, eg:

``` shell
$ hledger bal -% amt:`>0`
$ hledger bal -% amt:`<0`
```

Similarly, if the amounts in a column have mixed commodities, convert
them to one commodity with `-B`, `-V`, `-X` or `--value`, or make a
separate report for each commodity:

``` shell
$ hledger bal -% cur:\\$
$ hledger bal -% cur:€
```

#### Multi-period balance report

With a [report interval](#report-intervals) (set by the `-D/--daily`,
`-W/--weekly`, `-M/--monthly`, `-Q/--quarterly`, `-Y/--yearly`, or
`-p/--period` flag), `balance` shows a tabular report, with columns
representing successive time periods (and a title):

``` shell
$ hledger -f examples/sample.journal bal --quarterly income expenses -E
Balance changes in 2008:

                   ||  2008q1  2008q2  2008q3  2008q4 
===================++=================================
 expenses:food     ||       0      $1       0       0 
 expenses:supplies ||       0      $1       0       0 
 income:gifts      ||       0     $-1       0       0 
 income:salary     ||     $-1       0       0       0 
-------------------++---------------------------------
                   ||     $-1      $1       0       0 
```

Notes:

-   The report\'s start/end dates will be expanded, if necessary, to
    fully encompass the displayed subperiods (so that the first and last
    subperiods have the same duration as the others).
-   Leading and trailing periods (columns) containing all zeroes are not
    shown, unless `-E/--empty` is used.
-   Accounts (rows) containing all zeroes are not shown, unless
    `-E/--empty` is used.
-   Amounts with many commodities are shown in abbreviated form, unless
    `--no-elide` is used. *(experimental)*
-   Average and/or total columns can be added with the `-A/--average`
    and `-T/--row-total` flags.
-   The `--transpose` flag can be used to exchange rows and columns.
-   The `--pivot FIELD` option causes a different transaction field to
    be used as \"account name\". See [PIVOTING](#pivoting).

Multi-period reports with many periods can be too wide for easy viewing
in the terminal. Here are some ways to handle that:

-   Hide the totals row with `-N/--no-total`
-   Convert to a single currency with `-V`
-   Maximize the terminal window
-   Reduce the terminal\'s font size
-   View with a pager like less, eg:
    `hledger bal -D --color=yes | less -RS`
-   Output as CSV and use a CSV viewer like
    [visidata](https://www.visidata.org)
    (`hledger bal -D -O csv | vd -f csv`), Emacs\'
    [csv-mode](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/csv-mode.html)
    (`M-x csv-mode, C-c C-a`), or a spreadsheet
    (`hledger bal -D -o a.csv && open a.csv`)
-   Output as HTML and view with a browser:
    `hledger bal -D -o a.html && open a.html`

#### Balance change, end balance

It\'s important to be clear on the meaning of the numbers shown in
balance reports. Here is some terminology we use:

A ***balance change*** is the net amount added to, or removed from, an
account during some period.

An ***end balance*** is the amount accumulated in an account as of some
date (and some time, but hledger doesn\'t store that; assume end of day
in your timezone). It is the sum of previous balance changes.

We call it a ***historical end balance*** if it includes all balance
changes since the account was created. For a real world account, this
means it will match the \"historical record\", eg the balances reported
in your bank statements or bank web UI. (If they are correct!)

In general, balance changes are what you want to see when reviewing
revenues and expenses, and historical end balances are what you want to
see when reviewing or reconciling asset, liability and equity accounts.

`balance` shows balance changes by default. To see accurate historical
end balances:

1.  Initialise account starting balances with an \"opening balances\"
    transaction (a transfer from equity to the account), unless the
    journal covers the account\'s full lifetime.

2.  Include all of of the account\'s prior postings in the report, by
    not specifying a [report start date](#report-start-end-date), or by
    using the `-H/--historical` flag. (`-H` causes report start date to
    be ignored when summing postings.)

#### Balance report types

The balance command is quite flexible; here is the full detail on how to
control what it reports. If the following seems complicated, don\'t
worry - this is for advanced reporting, and it does take time and
experimentation to get familiar with all the report modes.

There are three important option groups:

`hledger balance [CALCULATIONTYPE] [ACCUMULATIONTYPE] [VALUATIONTYPE] ...`

##### Calculation type

The basic calculation to perform for each table cell. It is one of:

-   `--sum` : sum the posting amounts (**default**)
-   `--budget` : sum the amounts, but also show the budget goal amount
    (for each account/period)
-   `--valuechange` : show the change in period-end historical balance
    values (caused by deposits, withdrawals, and/or market price
    fluctuations)
-   `--gain` : show the unrealised capital gain/loss, (the current
    valued balance minus each amount\'s original cost)
-   `--count` : show the count of postings

##### Accumulation type

How amounts should accumulate across report periods. Another way to say
it: which time period\'s postings should contribute to each cell\'s
calculation. It is one of:

-   `--change` : calculate with postings from column start to column
    end, ie \"just this column\". Typically used to see
    revenues/expenses. (**default for balance, incomestatement**)

-   `--cumulative` : calculate with postings from report start to column
    end, ie \"previous columns plus this column\". Typically used to
    show changes accumulated since the report\'s start date. Not often
    used.

-   `--historical/-H` : calculate with postings from journal start to
    column end, ie \"all postings from before report start date until
    this column\'s end\". Typically used to see historical end balances
    of assets/liabilities/equity. (**default for balancesheet,
    balancesheetequity, cashflow**)

##### Valuation type

Which kind of value or cost conversion should be applied, if any, before
displaying the report. It is one of:

-   no valuation type : don\'t convert to cost or value (**default**)
-   `--value=cost[,COMM]` : convert amounts to cost (then optionally to
    some other commodity)
-   `--value=then[,COMM]` : convert amounts to market value on
    transaction dates
-   `--value=end[,COMM]` : convert amounts to market value on period end
    date(s)\
    (**default with `--valuechange`, `--gain`**)
-   `--value=now[,COMM]` : convert amounts to market value on today\'s
    date
-   `--value=YYYY-MM-DD[,COMM]` : convert amounts to market value on
    another date

or one of the equivalent simpler flags:

-   `-B/--cost` : like \--value=cost (though, note \--cost and \--value
    are independent options which can both be used at once)
-   `-V/--market` : like \--value=end
-   `-X COMM/--exchange COMM` : like \--value=end,COMM

See [Cost reporting](#cost-reporting) and [Valuation](#valuation) for
more about these.

##### Combining balance report types

Most combinations of these options should produce reasonable reports,
but if you find any that seem wrong or misleading, let us know. The
following restrictions are applied:

-   `--valuechange` implies `--value=end`
-   `--valuechange` makes `--change` the default when used with the
    `balancesheet`/`balancesheetequity` commands
-   `--cumulative` or `--historical` disables `--row-total/-T`

For reference, here is what the combinations of accumulation and
valuation show:

| Valuation:\><br> Accumulation:v | no valuation                                                     | `--value= then`                                                    | `--value= end`                                              | `--value= YYYY-MM-DD /now`                            |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| `--change`                      | change in period                                                 | sum of posting-date market values in period                        | period-end value of change in period                        | DATE-value of change in period                        |
| `--cumulative`                  | change from report start to period end                           | sum of posting-date market values from report start to period end  | period-end value of change from report start to period end  | DATE-value of change from report start to period end  |
| `--historical /-H`              | change from journal start to period end (historical end balance) | sum of posting-date market values from journal start to period end | period-end value of change from journal start to period end | DATE-value of change from journal start to period end |

#### Budget report

The `--budget` report type activates extra columns showing any budget
goals for each account and period. The budget goals are defined by
[periodic transactions](hledger.html#periodic-transactions). This is
useful for comparing planned and actual income, expenses, time usage,
etc.

For example, you can take average monthly expenses in the common expense
categories to construct a minimal monthly budget:

``` journal
;; Budget
~ monthly
  income  $2000
  expenses:food    $400
  expenses:bus     $50
  expenses:movies  $30
  assets:bank:checking

;; Two months worth of expenses
2017-11-01
  income  $1950
  expenses:food    $396
  expenses:bus     $49
  expenses:movies  $30
  expenses:supplies  $20
  assets:bank:checking

2017-12-01
  income  $2100
  expenses:food    $412
  expenses:bus     $53
  expenses:gifts   $100
  assets:bank:checking
```

You can now see a monthly budget report:

``` shell
$ hledger balance -M --budget
Budget performance in 2017/11/01-2017/12/31:

                      ||                      Nov                       Dec 
======================++====================================================
 assets               || $-2445 [  99% of $-2480]  $-2665 [ 107% of $-2480] 
 assets:bank          || $-2445 [  99% of $-2480]  $-2665 [ 107% of $-2480] 
 assets:bank:checking || $-2445 [  99% of $-2480]  $-2665 [ 107% of $-2480] 
 expenses             ||   $495 [ 103% of   $480]    $565 [ 118% of   $480] 
 expenses:bus         ||    $49 [  98% of    $50]     $53 [ 106% of    $50] 
 expenses:food        ||   $396 [  99% of   $400]    $412 [ 103% of   $400] 
 expenses:movies      ||    $30 [ 100% of    $30]       0 [   0% of    $30] 
 income               ||  $1950 [  98% of  $2000]   $2100 [ 105% of  $2000] 
----------------------++----------------------------------------------------
                      ||      0 [              0]       0 [              0] 
```

This is different from a normal balance report in several ways.
Currently:

-   Accounts with budget goals during the report period, and their
    parents, are shown.
-   Their subaccounts are not shown (regardless of the depth setting).
-   Accounts without budget goals, if any, are aggregated and shown as
    \"\<unbudgeted\>\".
-   Amounts are always inclusive (subaccount-including), even in list
    mode.
-   After each actual amount, the corresponding goal amount and
    percentage of goal reached are also shown, in square brackets.

This means that the numbers displayed will not always add up! Eg above,
the `expenses` actual amount includes the gifts and supplies
transactions, but the `expenses:gifts` and `expenses:supplies` accounts
are not shown, as they have no budget amounts declared.

This can be confusing. When you need to make things clearer, use the
`-E/--empty` flag, which will reveal all accounts including unbudgeted
ones, giving the full picture. Eg:

``` shell
$ hledger balance -M --budget --empty
Budget performance in 2017/11/01-2017/12/31:

                      ||                      Nov                       Dec 
======================++====================================================
 assets               || $-2445 [  99% of $-2480]  $-2665 [ 107% of $-2480] 
 assets:bank          || $-2445 [  99% of $-2480]  $-2665 [ 107% of $-2480] 
 assets:bank:checking || $-2445 [  99% of $-2480]  $-2665 [ 107% of $-2480] 
 expenses             ||   $495 [ 103% of   $480]    $565 [ 118% of   $480] 
 expenses:bus         ||    $49 [  98% of    $50]     $53 [ 106% of    $50] 
 expenses:food        ||   $396 [  99% of   $400]    $412 [ 103% of   $400] 
 expenses:gifts       ||      0                      $100                   
 expenses:movies      ||    $30 [ 100% of    $30]       0 [   0% of    $30] 
 expenses:supplies    ||    $20                         0                   
 income               ||  $1950 [  98% of  $2000]   $2100 [ 105% of  $2000] 
----------------------++----------------------------------------------------
                      ||      0 [              0]       0 [              0] 
```

You can roll over unspent budgets to next period with `--cumulative`:

``` shell
$ hledger balance -M --budget --cumulative
Budget performance in 2017/11/01-2017/12/31:

                      ||                      Nov                       Dec

It\'s common to limit budgets/budget reports to just expenses

    hledger bal -M --budget expenses

or just revenues and expenses (eg, using account types):

    hledger bal -M --budget type:rx

It\'s also common to limit or convert them to a single currency
(`cur:COMM` or `-X COMM [--infer-market-prices]`). If showing multiple
currencies, `--layout bare` or `--layout tall` can help.

For more examples and notes, see [Budgeting](/budgeting.html).

##### Budget report start date

This might be a bug, but for now: when making budget reports, it\'s a
good idea to explicitly set the report\'s start date to the first day of
a reporting period, because a periodic rule like `~ monthly` generates
its transactions on the 1st of each month, and if your journal has no
regular transactions on the 1st, the default report start date could
exclude that budget goal, which can be a little surprising. Eg here the
default report period is just the day of 2020-01-15:

``` journal
~ monthly in 2020
  (expenses:food)  $500

2020-01-15
  expenses:food    $400
  assets:checking
```

``` shell
$ hledger bal expenses --budget
Budget performance in 2020-01-15:

              || 2020-01-15 
==============++============
 <unbudgeted> ||       $400 
--------------++------------
              ||       $400 
```

To avoid this, specify the budget report\'s period, or at least the
start date, with `-b`/`-e`/`-p`/`date:`, to ensure it includes the
budget goal transactions (periodic transactions) that you want. Eg,
adding `-b 2020/1/1` to the above:

``` shell
$ hledger bal expenses --budget -b 2020/1/1
Budget performance in 2020-01-01..2020-01-15:

               || 2020-01-01..2020-01-15 
===============++========================
 expenses:food ||     $400 [80% of $500] 
---------------++------------------------
               ||     $400 [80% of $500] 
```

##### Budgets and subaccounts

You can add budgets to any account in your account hierarchy. If you
have budgets on both parent account and some of its children, then
budget(s) of the child account(s) would be added to the budget of their
parent, much like account balances behave.

In the most simple case this means that once you add a budget to any
account, all its parents would have budget as well.

To illustrate this, consider the following budget:

    ~ monthly from 2019/01
        expenses:personal             $1,000.00
        expenses:personal:electronics    $100.00
        liabilities

With this, monthly budget for electronics is defined to be \$100 and
budget for personal expenses is an additional \$1000, which implicitly
means that budget for both `expenses:personal` and `expenses` is \$1100.

Transactions in `expenses:personal:electronics` will be counted both
towards its \$100 budget and \$1100 of `expenses:personal` , and
transactions in any other subaccount of `expenses:personal` would be
counted towards only towards the budget of `expenses:personal`.

For example, let\'s consider these transactions:

``` journal
~ monthly from 2019/01
    expenses:personal             $1,000.00
    expenses:personal:electronics    $100.00
    liabilities

2019/01/01 Google home hub
    expenses:personal:electronics          $90.00
    liabilities                           $-90.00

2019/01/02 Phone screen protector
    expenses:personal:electronics:upgrades          $10.00
    liabilities

2019/01/02 Weekly train ticket
    expenses:personal:train tickets       $153.00
    liabilities

2019/01/03 Flowers
    expenses:personal          $30.00
    liabilities
```

As you can see, we have transactions in
`expenses:personal:electronics:upgrades` and
`expenses:personal:train tickets`, and since both of these accounts are
without explicitly defined budget, these transactions would be counted
towards budgets of `expenses:personal:electronics` and
`expenses:personal` accordingly:

``` shell
$ hledger balance --budget -M
Budget performance in 2019/01:

                               ||                           Jan 
===============================++===============================
 expenses                      ||  $283.00 [  26% of  $1100.00] 
 expenses:personal             ||  $283.00 [  26% of  $1100.00] 
 expenses:personal:electronics ||  $100.00 [ 100% of   $100.00] 
 liabilities                   || $-283.00 [  26% of $-1100.00] 
-------------------------------++-------------------------------
                               ||        0 [                 0] 
```

And with `--empty`, we can get a better picture of budget allocation and
consumption:

``` shell
$ hledger balance --budget -M --empty
Budget performance in 2019/01:

                                        ||                           Jan 
========================================++===============================
 expenses                               ||  $283.00 [  26% of  $1100.00] 
 expenses:personal                      ||  $283.00 [  26% of  $1100.00] 
 expenses:personal:electronics          ||  $100.00 [ 100% of   $100.00] 
 expenses:personal:electronics:upgrades ||   $10.00                      
 expenses:personal:train tickets        ||  $153.00                      
 liabilities                            || $-283.00 [  26% of $-1100.00] 
----------------------------------------++-------------------------------
                                        ||        0 [                 0] 
```

##### Selecting budget goals

The budget report evaluates periodic transaction rules to generate
special \"goal transactions\", which generate the goal amounts for each
account in each report subperiod. When troubleshooting, you can use
`print --forecast` to show these as forecasted transactions:

``` shell
$ hledger print --forecast=BUDGETREPORTPERIOD tag:generated
```

By default, the budget report uses all available periodic transaction
rules to generate goals. This includes rules with a different report
interval from your report. Eg if you have daily, weekly and monthly
periodic rules, all of these will contribute to the goals in a monthly
budget report.

You can select a subset of periodic rules by providing an argument to
the `--budget` flag. `--budget=DESCPAT` will match all periodic rules
whose description contains DESCPAT, a case-insensitive substring (not a
regular expression or query). This means you can give your periodic
rules descriptions (remember that [two spaces are
needed](#two-spaces-between-period-expression-and-description)), and
then select from multiple budgets defined in your journal.

##### Budget vs forecast

`hledger --forecast ...` and `hledger balance --budget ...` are separate
features, though both of them use the periodic transaction rules defined
in the journal, and both of them generate temporary transactions for
reporting purposes (\"forecast transactions\" and \"budget goal
transactions\", respectively). You can use both features at the same
time if you want. Here are some differences between them, as of hledger
1.29:

CLI:

-   \--forecast is a general hledger option, usable with any command
-   \--budget is a `balance` command option, usable only with that
    command.

Visibility of generated transactions:

-   forecast transactions are visible in any report, like ordinary
    transactions
-   budget goal transactions are invisible except for the goal amounts
    they produce in \--budget reports.

Periodic transaction rules:

-   \--forecast uses all available periodic transaction rules
-   \--budget uses all periodic rules (`--budget`) or a selected subset
    (`--budget=DESCPAT`)

Period of generated transactions:

-   \--forecast generates forecast transactions
    -   from after the last regular transaction to the end of the report
        period (`--forecast`)
    -   or, during a specified period (`--forecast=PERIODEXPR`)
    -   possibly further restricted by a period specified in the
        periodic transaction rule
    -   and always restricted within the bounds of the report period
-   \--budget generates budget goal transactions
    -   throughout the report period
    -   possibly restricted by a period specified in the periodic
        transaction rule.

#### Data layout

The `--layout` option affects how balance reports show multi-commodity
amounts and commodity symbols, which can improve readability. It can
also normalise the data for easy consumption by other programs. It has
four possible values:

-   `--layout=wide[,WIDTH]`: commodities are shown on a single line,
    optionally elided to WIDTH
-   `--layout=tall`: each commodity is shown on a separate line
-   `--layout=bare`: commodity symbols are in their own column, amounts
    are bare numbers
-   `--layout=tidy`: data is normalised to easily-consumed \"tidy\"
    form, with one row per data value

Here are the `--layout` modes supported by each [output
format](#output-format); note only CSV output supports all of them:

| \-   | txt | csv | html | json | sql |
|------|-----|-----|------|------|-----|
| wide | Y   | Y   | Y    |      |     |
| tall | Y   | Y   | Y    |      |     |
| bare | Y   | Y   | Y    |      |     |
| tidy |     | Y   |      |      |     |

Examples:

-   Wide layout. With many commodities, reports can be very wide:

    ``` shell
    $ hledger -f examples/bcexample.hledger bal assets:us:etrade -3 -T -Y --layout=wide

    ```

-   Limited wide layout. A width limit reduces the width, but some
    commodities will be hidden:

    ``` shell
    $ hledger -f examples/bcexample.hledger bal assets:us:etrade -3 -T -Y --layout=wide,32
    Balance changes in 2012-01-01..2014-12-31:

    ```

-   Bare layout. Commodity symbols are kept in one column, each
    commodity gets its own report row, account names are repeated:

    ``` shell
    $ hledger -f examples/bcexample.hledger bal assets:us:etrade -3 -T -Y --layout=bare
    Balance changes in 2012-01-01..2014-12-31:

    ```

-   Bare layout also affects [CSV output](#output-format), which is
    useful for producing data that is easier to consume, eg for making
    charts:

    ``` shell
    $ hledger -f examples/bcexample.hledger bal assets:us:etrade -3 -O csv --layout=bare
    "account","commodity","balance"
    "Assets:US:ETrade","GLD","70.00"
    "Assets:US:ETrade","ITOT","17.00"
    "Assets:US:ETrade","USD","5120.50"
    "Assets:US:ETrade","VEA","36.00"
    "Assets:US:ETrade","VHT","294.00"
    "total","GLD","70.00"
    "total","ITOT","17.00"
    "total","USD","5120.50"
    "total","VEA","36.00"
    "total","VHT","294.00"
    ```

-   Tidy layout produces normalised \"tidy data\", where every variable
    has its own column and each row represents a single data point. See
    <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html>
    for more. This is the easiest kind of data for other software to
    consume. Here\'s how it looks:

    ``` shell
    $ hledger -f examples/bcexample.hledger bal assets:us:etrade -3 -Y -O csv --layout=tidy
    "account","period","start_date","end_date","commodity","value"
    "Assets:US:ETrade","2012","2012-01-01","2012-12-31","GLD","0"
    "Assets:US:ETrade","2012","2012-01-01","2012-12-31","ITOT","10.00"

-   `bal -M --valuechange investments`\
    Show monthly change in market value of investment assets.

-   `bal investments --valuechange -D date:lastweek amt:'>1000' -STA [--invert]`\
    Show top gainers \[or losers\] last week

### balancesheet

(bs)

This command displays a [balance
sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet), showing historical
ending balances of asset and liability accounts. (To see equity as well,
use the [balancesheetequity](#balancesheetequity) command.) Amounts are
shown with normal positive sign, as in conventional financial
statements.

This report shows accounts declared with the `Asset`, `Cash` or
`Liability` type (see [account
types](https://hledger.org/hledger.html#account-types)). Or if no such
accounts are declared, it shows top-level accounts named `asset` or
`liability` (case insensitive, plurals allowed) and their subaccounts.

Example:

``` shell
$ hledger balancesheet
Balance Sheet

Assets:
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
--------------------
                 $-1

Liabilities:
                  $1  liabilities:debts
--------------------
                  $1

Total:
--------------------
                   0
```

This command is a higher-level variant of the [`balance`](#balance)
command, and supports many of that command\'s features, such as
multi-period reports. It is similar to
`hledger balance -H assets liabilities`, but with smarter account
detection, and liabilities displayed with their sign flipped.

This command also supports the [output
destination](hledger.html#output-destination) and [output
format](hledger.html#output-format) options The output formats supported
are `txt`, `csv`, `html`, and (experimental) `json`.

### balancesheetequity

(bse)

This command displays a [balance
sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet), showing historical
ending balances of asset, liability and equity accounts. Amounts are
shown with normal positive sign, as in conventional financial
statements.

This report shows accounts declared with the `Asset`, `Cash`,
`Liability` or `Equity` type (see [account
types](https://hledger.org/hledger.html#account-types)). Or if no such
accounts are declared, it shows top-level accounts named `asset`,
`liability` or `equity` (case insensitive, plurals allowed) and their
subaccounts.

Example:

``` shell
$ hledger balancesheetequity
Balance Sheet With Equity

Assets:
                 $-2  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-3    cash
--------------------
                 $-2

Liabilities:
                  $1  liabilities:debts
--------------------
                  $1

Equity:
          $1  equity:owner
--------------------
          $1

Total:
--------------------
                   0
```

This command is a higher-level variant of the [`balance`](#balance)
command, and supports many of that command\'s features, such as
multi-period reports. It is similar to
`hledger balance -H assets liabilities equity`, but with smarter account
detection, and liabilities/equity displayed with their sign flipped.

This command also supports the [output
destination](hledger.html#output-destination) and [output
format](hledger.html#output-format) options The output formats supported
are `txt`, `csv`, `html`, and (experimental) `json`.

### cashflow

(cf)

This command displays a [cashflow
statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow_statement), showing
the inflows and outflows affecting \"cash\" (ie, liquid, easily
convertible) assets. Amounts are shown with normal positive sign, as in
conventional financial statements.

This report shows accounts declared with the `Cash` type (see [account
types](https://hledger.org/hledger.html#account-types)). Or if no such
accounts are declared, it shows accounts

-   under a top-level account named `asset` (case insensitive, plural
    allowed)
-   whose name contains some variation of `cash`, `bank`, `checking` or
    `saving`.

More precisely: all accounts matching this case insensitive regular
expression:

`^assets?(:.+)?:(cash|bank|che(ck|que?)(ing)?|savings?|currentcash)(:|$)`

and their subaccounts.

An example cashflow report:

``` shell
$ hledger cashflow
Cashflow Statement

Cash flows:
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
--------------------
                 $-1

Total:
--------------------
                 $-1
```

This command is a higher-level variant of the [`balance`](#balance)
command, and supports many of that command\'s features, such as
multi-period reports. It is similar to
`hledger balance assets not:fixed not:investment not:receivable`, but
with smarter account detection.

This command also supports the [output
destination](hledger.html#output-destination) and [output
format](hledger.html#output-format) options The output formats supported
are `txt`, `csv`, `html`, and (experimental) `json`.

### check

Check for various kinds of errors in your data.

hledger provides a number of built-in error checks to help prevent
problems in your data. Some of these are run automatically; or, you can
use this `check` command to run them on demand, with no output and a
zero exit code if all is well. Specify their names (or a prefix) as
argument(s).

Some examples:

``` shell
hledger check      # basic checks
hledger check -s   # basic + strict checks
hledger check ordereddates payees  # basic + two other checks
```

If you are an Emacs user, you can also configure flymake-hledger or
flycheck-hledger to run these checks, providing instant feedback as
you edit the journal.

Here are the checks currently available:

#### Basic checks

These checks are always run automatically, by (almost) all hledger
commands, including `check`:

-   **parseable** - data files are well-formed and can be [successfully
    parsed](hledger.html#input-files)

-   **balancedwithautoconversion** - all transactions are
    [balanced](hledger.html#postings), inferring missing amounts where
    necessary, and possibly converting commodities using [costs](#costs)
    or automatically-inferred costs

-   **assertions** - all [balance assertions](#balance-assertions) in
    the journal are passing. (This check can be disabled with
    `-I`/`--ignore-assertions`.)

#### Strict checks

These additional checks are run when the `-s`/`--strict` ([strict
mode](#strict-mode)) flag is used. Or, they can be run by giving their
names as arguments to `check`:

-   **accounts** - all account names used by transactions [have been
    declared](hledger.html#account-error-checking)

-   **commodities** - all commodity symbols used [have been
    declared](hledger.html#commodity-error-checking)

-   **balancednoautoconversion** - transactions are balanced, possibly
    using explicit costs but not [inferred ones](#costs)

#### Other checks

These checks can be run only by giving their names as arguments to
`check`. They are more specialised and not desirable for everyone,
therefore optional:

-   **ordereddates** - transactions are ordered by date within each file

-   **payees** - all payees used by transactions [have been
    declared](#payee-directive)

-   **recentassertions** - all accounts with balance assertions have a
    balance assertion no more than 7 days before their latest posting

-   **tags** - all tags used by transactions [have been
    declared](#tag-directive)

-   **uniqueleafnames** - all account leaf names are unique

#### Custom checks

A few more checks are are available as separate [add-on
commands](#add-on-commands), in
<https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/tree/master/bin>:

-   **hledger-check-tagfiles** - all tag values containing / (a forward
    slash) exist as file paths

-   **hledger-check-fancyassertions** - more complex balance assertions
    are passing

You could make similar scripts to perform your own custom checks. See:
Cookbook -\> [Scripting](scripting.html).

#### More about specific checks

`hledger check recentassertions` will complain if any balance-asserted
account does not have a balance assertion within 7 days before its
latest posting. This aims to prevent the situation where you are
regularly updating your journal, but forgetting to check your balances
against the real world, then one day must dig back through months of
data to find an error. It assumes that adding a balance assertion
requires/reminds you to check the real-world balance. That may not be
true if you auto-generate balance assertions from bank data; in that
case, I recommend to import transactions uncleared, then use the
manual-review-and-mark-cleared phase as a reminder to check the latest
assertions against real-world balances.

### close

(equity)

Generate transactions which transfer account balances to and/or from
another account (typically equity). This can be useful for migrating
balances to a new journal file, or for merging earnings into equity at
end of accounting period.

By default, it prints a transaction that zeroes out ALE accounts (asset,
liability, equity accounts; this requires account types to be
configured); or if ACCTQUERY is provided, the accounts matched by that.

*(experimental)*

This command has four main modes, corresponding to the most common use
cases:

1.  With `--close` (default), it prints a \"closing balances\"
    transaction that zeroes out ALE (asset, liability, equity) accounts
    by default (this requires [account types](hledger.md#account-types)
    to be inferred or declared); or, the accounts matched by the
    provided ACCTQUERY arguments.

2.  With `--open`, it prints an opposite \"opening balances\"
    transaction that restores those balances from zero. This is similar
    to Ledger\'s equity command.

3.  With `--migrate`, it prints both the closing and opening
    transactions. This is the preferred way to migrate balances to a new
    file: run `hledger close --migrate`, add the closing transaction at
    the end of the old file, and add the opening transaction at the
    start of the new file. The matching closing/opening transactions
    cancel each other out, preserving correct balances during multi-file
    reporting.

4.  With `--retain`, it prints a \"retain earnings\" transaction that
    transfers RX (revenue and expense) balances to
    `equity:retained earnings`. Businesses traditionally do this at the
    end of each accounting period; it is less necessary with
    computer-based accounting, but it could still be useful if you want
    to see the accounting equation (A=L+E) satisfied.

In all modes, the defaults can be overridden:

-   the transaction descriptions can be changed with `--close-desc=DESC`
    and `--open-desc=DESC`
-   the account to transfer to/from can be changed with
    `--close-acct=ACCT` and `--open-acct=ACCT`
-   the accounts to be closed/opened can be changed with `ACCTQUERY`
    (account query arguments).
-   the closing/opening dates can be changed with `-e DATE` (a report
    end date)

By default just one destination/source posting will be used, with its
amount left implicit. With `--x/--explicit`, the amount will be shown
explicitly, and if it involves multiple commodities, a separate posting
will be generated for each of them (similar to `print -x`).

With `--show-costs`, any amount costs are shown, with separate postings
for each cost. This is currently the best way to view investment lots.
If you have many currency conversion or investment transactions, it can
generate very large journal entries.

With `--interleaved`, each individual transfer is shown with source and
destination postings next to each other. This could be useful for
troubleshooting.

The default closing date is yesterday, or the journal\'s end date,
whichever is later. You can change this by specifying a [report end
date](#report-start--end-date) with `-e`. The last day of the report
period will be the closing date, eg `-e 2024` means \"close on
2023-12-31\". The opening date is always the day after the closing date.

#### close and balance assertions

Balance assertions will be generated, verifying that the accounts have
been reset to zero (and then restored to their previous balances, if
there is an opening transaction).

These provide useful error checking, but you can ignore them temporarily
with `-I`, or remove them if you prefer.

You probably should avoid filtering transactions by status or realness
(`-C`, `-R`, `status:`), or generating postings (`--auto`), with this
command, since the balance assertions would depend on these.

Note custom posting dates spanning the file boundary will disrupt the
balance assertions:

``` journal
2023-12-30 a purchase made in december, cleared in january
    expenses:food          5
    assets:bank:checking  -5  ; date: 2023-01-02
```

To solve that you can transfer the money to and from a temporary
account, in effect splitting the multi-day transaction into two
single-day transactions:

``` journal
; in 2022.journal:
2022-12-30 a purchase made in december, cleared in january
    expenses:food          5
    equity:pending        -5

; in 2023.journal:
2023-01-02 last year's transaction cleared
    equity:pending         5 = 0
    assets:bank:checking  -5
```

#### Example: retain earnings

Record 2022\'s revenues/expenses as retained earnings on 2022-12-31,
appending the generated transaction to the journal:

``` shell
$ hledger close --retain -f 2022.journal -p 2022 >> 2022.journal
```

Note 2022\'s income statement will now show only zeroes, because
revenues and expenses have been moved entirely to equity. To see them
again, you could exclude the retain transaction:

``` shell
$ hledger -f 2022.journal is not:desc:'retain earnings'
```

#### Example: migrate balances to a new file

Close assets/liabilities/equity on 2022-12-31 and re-open them on
2023-01-01:

``` shell
$ hledger close --migrate -f 2022.journal -p 2022
# copy/paste the closing transaction to the end of 2022.journal
# copy/paste the opening transaction to the start of 2023.journal
```

Now 2022\'s balance sheet will show only zeroes, indicating a balanced
accounting equation. ([Unless](/investments.html#a-more-correct-entry)
you are using @/@@ notation - in that case, try adding \--infer-equity.)
To see the end-of-year balances again, you could exclude the closing
transaction:

``` shell
$ hledger -f 2022.journal bs not:desc:'closing balances'
```

#### Example: excluding closing/opening transactions

When combining many files for multi-year reports, the closing/opening
transactions cause some noise in transaction-oriented reports like
`print` and `register`. You can exclude them as shown above, but
`not:desc:...` is not ideal as it depends on consistent descriptions;
also you will want to avoid excluding the very first opening
transaction, which could be awkward. Here is one alternative, using
tags:

Add `clopen:` tags to all opening/closing balances transactions except
the first, like this:

``` journal
; 2021.journal
2021-06-01 first opening balances
...
2021-12-31 closing balances  ; clopen:2022
...
```

``` journal
; 2022.journal
2022-01-01 opening balances  ; clopen:2022
...
2022-12-31 closing balances  ; clopen:2023
...
```

``` journal
; 2023.journal
2023-01-01 opening balances  ; clopen:2023
...
```

Now, assuming a combined journal like:

``` journal
; all.journal
include 2021.journal
include 2022.journal
include 2023.journal
```

The `clopen:` tag can exclude all but the first opening transaction. To
show a clean multi-year checking register:

``` shell
$ hledger -f all.journal areg checking not:tag:clopen
```

And the year values allow more precision. To show 2022\'s year-end
balance sheet:

``` shell
$ hledger -f all.journal bs -e2023 not:tag:clopen=2023
```

### codes

List the codes seen in transactions, in the order parsed.

This command prints the value of each transaction\'s code field, in the
order transactions were parsed. The transaction code is an optional
value written in parentheses between the date and description, often
used to store a cheque number, order number or similar.

Transactions aren\'t required to have a code, and missing or empty codes
will not be shown by default. With the `-E`/`--empty` flag, they will be
printed as blank lines.

You can add a query to select a subset of transactions.

Examples:

``` journal
2022/1/1 (123) Supermarket   
 Food       $5.00
 Checking    

2022/1/2 (124) Post Office
 Postage    $8.32
 Checking

2022/1/3 Supermarket
 Food      $11.23
 Checking 

2022/1/4 (126) Post Office
 Postage    $3.21
 Checking
```

``` shell
$ hledger codes
123
124
126
```

``` shell
$ hledger codes -E
123
124

126
```

### commodities

List all commodity/currency symbols used or declared in the journal.

### demo

Play demos of hledger usage in the terminal, if asciinema is installed.

Run this command with no argument to list the demos. To play a demo,
write its number or a prefix or substring of its title. Tips:

Make your terminal window large enough to see the demo clearly.

Use the -s/\--speed SPEED option to set your preferred playback speed,
eg `-s4` to play at 4x original speed or `-s.5` to play at half speed.
The default speed is 2x.

Other asciinema options can be added following a double dash, eg
`-- -i.1` to limit pauses or `-- -h` to list asciinema\'s other options.

During playback, several keys are available: SPACE to pause/unpause, .
to step forward (while paused), CTRL-c quit.

Examples:

``` shell
$ hledger demo               # list available demos
$ hledger demo 1             # play the first demo at default speed (2x)
$ hledger demo install -s4   # play the "install" demo at 4x speed
```

### descriptions

List the unique descriptions that appear in transactions.

This command lists the unique descriptions that appear in transactions,
in alphabetic order. You can add a query to select a subset of
transactions.

Example:

``` shell
$ hledger descriptions
Store Name
Gas Station | Petrol
Person A
```

### diff

Compares a particular account\'s transactions in two input files. It
shows any transactions to this account which are in one file but not in
the other.

More precisely, for each posting affecting this account in either file,
it looks for a corresponding posting in the other file which posts the
same amount to the same account (ignoring date, description, etc.) Since
postings not transactions are compared, this also works when multiple
bank transactions have been combined into a single journal entry.

This is useful eg if you have downloaded an account\'s transactions from
your bank (eg as CSV data). When hledger and your bank disagree about
the account balance, you can compare the bank data with your journal to
find out the cause.

Examples:

``` shell
$ hledger diff -f $LEDGER_FILE -f bank.csv assets:bank:giro 
These transactions are in the first file only:

2014/01/01 Opening Balances
    assets:bank:giro              EUR ...
    ...
    equity:opening balances       EUR -...

These transactions are in the second file only:
```

### files

List all files included in the journal. With a REGEX argument, only file
names matching the regular expression (case sensitive) are shown.

### help

Show the hledger user manual in the terminal, with `info`, `man`, or a
pager. With a TOPIC argument, open it at that topic if possible. TOPIC
can be any heading in the manual, or a heading prefix, case insensitive.
Eg: `commands`, `print`, `forecast`, `journal`, `amount`,
`"auto postings"`.

This command shows the hledger manual built in to your hledger version.
It can be useful when offline, or when you prefer the terminal to a web
browser, or when the appropriate hledger manual or viewing tools are not
installed on your system.

By default it chooses the best viewer found in \$PATH, trying (in this
order): `info`, `man`, `$PAGER`, `less`, `more`. You can force the use
of info, man, or a pager with the `-i`, `-m`, or `-p` flags, If no
viewer can be found, or the command is run non-interactively, it just
prints the manual to stdout.

If using `info`, note that version 6 or greater is needed for TOPIC
lookup. If you are on mac you will likely have info 4.8, and should
consider installing a newer version, eg with `brew install texinfo`
(#1770).

Examples

``` shell
$ hledger help --help      # show how the help command works
$ hledger help             # show the hledger manual with info, man or $PAGER
$ hledger help journal     # show the journal topic in the hledger manual
$ hledger help -m journal  # show it with man, even if info is installed
```

### import

Read new transactions added to each FILE since last run, and add them to
the journal. Or with \--dry-run, just print the transactions that would
be added. Or with \--catchup, just mark all of the FILEs\' transactions
as imported, without actually importing any.

This command may append new transactions to the main journal file (which
should be in journal format). Existing transactions are not changed.
This is one of the few hledger commands that writes to the journal file
(see also `add`).

Unlike other hledger commands, with `import` the journal file is an
output file, and will be modified, though only by appending (existing
data will not be changed). The input files are specified as arguments,
so to import one or more CSV files to your main journal, you will run
`hledger import bank.csv` or perhaps `hledger import *.csv`.

Note you can import from any file format, though CSV files are the most
common import source, and these docs focus on that case.

#### Deduplication

As a convenience `import` does *deduplication* while reading
transactions. This does not mean \"ignore transactions that look the
same\", but rather \"ignore transactions that have been seen before\".
This is intended for when you are periodically importing foreign data
which may contain already-imported transactions. So eg, if every day you
download bank CSV files containing redundant data, you can safely run
`hledger import bank.csv` and only new transactions will be imported.
(`import` is idempotent.)

Since the items being read (CSV records, eg) often do not come with
unique identifiers, hledger detects new transactions by date, assuming
that:

1.  new items always have the newest dates
2.  item dates do not change across reads
3.  and items with the same date remain in the same relative order
    across reads.

These are often true of CSV files representing transactions, or true
enough so that it works pretty well in practice. 1 is important, but
violations of 2 and 3 amongst the old transactions won\'t matter (and if
you import often, the new transactions will be few, so less likely to be
the ones affected).

hledger remembers the latest date processed in each input file by saving
a hidden \".latest\" state file in the same directory. Eg when reading
`finance/bank.csv`, it will look for and update the
`finance/.latest.bank.csv` state file. The format is simple: one or more
lines containing the same ISO-format date (YYYY-MM-DD), meaning \"I have
processed transactions up to this date, and this many of them on that
date.\" Normally you won\'t see or manipulate these state files
yourself. But if needed, you can delete them to reset the state (making
all transactions \"new\"), or you can construct them to \"catch up\" to
a certain date.

Note deduplication (and updating of state files) can also be done by
[`print --new`](#print), but this is less often used.

#### Import testing

With `--dry-run`, the transactions that will be imported are printed to
the terminal, without updating your journal or state files. The output
is valid journal format, like the print command, so you can re-parse it.
Eg, to see any importable transactions which CSV rules have not
categorised:

``` shell
$ hledger import --dry bank.csv | hledger -f- -I print unknown
```

or (live updating):

``` shell
$ ls bank.csv* | entr bash -c 'echo ====; hledger import --dry bank.csv | hledger -f- -I print unknown'
```

Note: when importing from multiple files at once, it\'s currently
possible for some .latest files to be updated successfully, while the
actual import fails because of a problem in one of the files, leaving
them out of sync (and causing some transactions to be missed). To
prevent this, do a \--dry-run first and fix any problems before the real
import.

#### Importing balance assignments

Entries added by import will have their posting amounts made explicit
(like `hledger print -x`). This means that any [balance
assignments](https://hledger.org/hledger.html#balance-assignments) in
imported files must be evaluated; but, imported files don\'t get to see
the main file\'s account balances. As a result, importing entries with
balance assignments (eg from an institution that provides only balances
and not posting amounts) will probably generate incorrect posting
amounts. To avoid this problem, use print instead of import:

``` shell
$ hledger print IMPORTFILE [--new] >> $LEDGER_FILE
```

(If you think import should leave amounts implicit like print does,
please test it and send a pull request.)

#### Commodity display styles

Imported amounts will be formatted according to the canonical [commodity
styles](hledger.html#commodity-display-style) (declared or inferred) in
the main journal file.

### incomestatement

(is)

This command displays an [income
statement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_statement), showing
revenues and expenses during one or more periods. Amounts are shown with
normal positive sign, as in conventional financial statements.

This report shows accounts declared with the `Revenue` or `Expense` type
(see [account types](https://hledger.org/hledger.html#account-types)).
Or if no such accounts are declared, it shows top-level accounts named
`revenue` or `income` or `expense` (case insensitive, plurals allowed)
and their subaccounts.

Example:

``` shell
$ hledger incomestatement
Income Statement

Revenues:
                 $-2  income
                 $-1    gifts
                 $-1    salary
--------------------
                 $-2

Expenses:
                  $2  expenses
                  $1    food
                  $1    supplies
--------------------
                  $2

Total:
--------------------
                   0
```

This command is a higher-level variant of the [`balance`](#balance)
command, and supports many of that command\'s features, such as
multi-period reports. It is similar to
`hledger balance '(revenues|income)' expenses`, but with smarter account
detection, and revenues/income displayed with their sign flipped.

This command also supports the [output
destination](hledger.html#output-destination) and [output
format](hledger.html#output-format) options The output formats supported
are `txt`, `csv`, `html`, and (experimental) `json`.

### notes

List the unique notes that appear in transactions.

This command lists the unique notes that appear in transactions, in
alphabetic order. You can add a query to select a subset of
transactions. The note is the part of the transaction description after
a \| character (or if there is no \|, the whole description).

Example:

``` shell
$ hledger notes
Petrol
Snacks
```

### payees

List the unique payee/payer names that appear in transactions.

This command lists unique payee/payer names which have been declared
with payee directives (\--declared), used in transaction descriptions
(\--used), or both (the default).

The payee/payer is the part of the transaction description before a \|
character (or if there is no \|, the whole description).

You can add query arguments to select a subset of transactions. This
implies \--used.

Example:

``` shell
$ hledger payees
Store Name
Gas Station
Person A
```

### prices

Print [market price
directives](https://hledger.org/hledger.html#market-prices) from the
journal. With \--infer-market-prices, generate additional market prices
from [costs](https://hledger.org/hledger.html#costs). With
\--infer-reverse-prices, also generate market prices by inverting known
prices. Prices can be filtered by a query. Price amounts are displayed
with their full precision.

### print

Show transaction journal entries, sorted by date.

The print command displays full journal entries (transactions) from the
journal file, sorted by date (or with `--date2`, by [secondary
date](#secondary-dates)).

Amounts are shown mostly normalised to [commodity display
style](#commodity-display-styles), eg the placement of commodity symbols
will be consistent. All of their decimal places are shown, as in the
original journal entry (with one alteration: in some cases trailing
zeroes are added.)

Amounts are shown right-aligned within each transaction (but not across
all transactions).

Directives and inter-transaction comments are not shown, currently. This
means the print command is somewhat lossy, and if you are using it to
reformat your journal you should take care to also copy over the
directives and file-level comments.

Eg:

``` shell
$ hledger print
2008/01/01 income
    assets:bank:checking            $1
    income:salary                  $-1

2008/06/01 gift
    assets:bank:checking            $1
    income:gifts                   $-1

2008/06/02 save
    assets:bank:saving              $1
    assets:bank:checking           $-1

2008/06/03 * eat & shop
    expenses:food                $1
    expenses:supplies            $1
    assets:cash                 $-2

2008/12/31 * pay off
    liabilities:debts               $1
    assets:bank:checking           $-1
```

print\'s output is usually a valid [hledger
journal](https://hledger.org/hledger.html), and you can process it again
with a second hledger command. This can be useful for certain kinds of
search, eg:

``` shell
# Show running total of food expenses paid from cash.
# -f- reads from stdin. -I/--ignore-assertions is sometimes needed.
$ hledger print assets:cash | hledger -f- -I reg expenses:food
```

There are some situations where print\'s output can become unparseable:

-   [Valuation](#valuation) affects posting amounts but not [balance
    assertion](#balance-assertions) or [balance
    assignment](#balance-assignments) amounts, potentially causing those
    to [fail](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1429).
-   [Auto postings](#auto-postings) can generate postings with [too many
    missing
    amounts](https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/issues/1276).
-   [Account aliases can generate bad account
    names](#aliases-can-generate-bad-account-names).

Normally, the journal entry\'s explicit or implicit amount style is
preserved. For example, when an amount is omitted in the journal, it
will not appear in the output. Similarly, when a cost is implied but not
written, it will not appear in the output. You can use the
`-x`/`--explicit` flag to make all amounts and costs explicit, which can
be useful for troubleshooting or for making your journal more readable
and robust against data entry errors. `-x` is also implied by using any
of `-B`,`-V`,`-X`,`--value`.

Note, `-x`/`--explicit` will cause postings with a multi-commodity
amount (these can arise when a multi-commodity transaction has an
implicit amount) to be split into multiple single-commodity postings,
keeping the output parseable.

With `-B`/`--cost`, amounts with
[costs](https://hledger.org/hledger.html#costs) are converted to cost
using that price. This can be used for troubleshooting.

With `-m DESC`/`--match=DESC`, print does a fuzzy search for one recent
transaction whose description is most similar to DESC. DESC should
contain at least two characters. If there is no similar-enough match, no
transaction will be shown and the program exit code will be non-zero.

With `--new`, hledger prints only transactions it has not seen on a
previous run. This uses the same deduplication system as the
[`import`](#import) command. (See import\'s docs for details.)

This command also supports the [output
destination](hledger.html#output-destination) and [output
format](hledger.html#output-format) options The output formats supported
are `txt`, `csv`, and (experimental) `json` and `sql`.

Here\'s an example of print\'s CSV output:

``` shell
$ hledger print -Ocsv
"txnidx","date","date2","status","code","description","comment","account","amount","commodity","credit","debit","posting-status","posting-comment"
"1","2008/01/01","","","","income","","assets:bank:checking","1","$","","1","",""
"1","2008/01/01","","","","income","","income:salary","-1","$","1","","",""
"2","2008/06/01","","","","gift","","assets:bank:checking","1","$","","1","",""
"2","2008/06/01","","","","gift","","income:gifts","-1","$","1","","",""
"3","2008/06/02","","","","save","","assets:bank:saving","1","$","","1","",""
"3","2008/06/02","","","","save","","assets:bank:checking","-1","$","1","","",""
"4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","expenses:food","1","$","","1","",""
"4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","expenses:supplies","1","$","","1","",""
"4","2008/06/03","","*","","eat & shop","","assets:cash","-2","$","2","","",""
"5","2008/12/31","","*","","pay off","","liabilities:debts","1","$","","1","",""
"5","2008/12/31","","*","","pay off","","assets:bank:checking","-1","$","1","","",""
```

-   There is one CSV record per posting, with the parent transaction\'s
    fields repeated.
-   The \"txnidx\" (transaction index) field shows which postings belong
    to the same transaction. (This number might change if transactions
    are reordered within the file, files are parsed/included in a
    different order, etc.)
-   The amount is separated into \"commodity\" (the symbol) and
    \"amount\" (numeric quantity) fields.
-   The numeric amount is repeated in either the \"credit\" or \"debit\"
    column, for convenience. (Those names are not accurate in the
    accounting sense; it just puts negative amounts under credit and
    zero or greater amounts under debit.)

### register

(reg)

Show postings and their running total.

The register command displays matched postings, across all accounts, in
date order, with their running total or running historical balance. (See
also the [`aregister`](#aregister) command, which shows matched
transactions in a specific account.)

register normally shows line per posting, but note that multi-commodity
amounts will occupy multiple lines (one line per commodity).

It is typically used with a [query](#queries) selecting a particular
account, to see that account\'s activity:

``` shell
$ hledger register checking
2008/01/01 income               assets:bank:checking            $1           $1
2008/06/01 gift                 assets:bank:checking            $1           $2
2008/06/02 save                 assets:bank:checking           $-1           $1
2008/12/31 pay off              assets:bank:checking           $-1            0
```

With `--date2`, it shows and sorts by secondary date instead.

For performance reasons, column widths are chosen based on the first
1000 lines; this means unusually wide values in later lines can cause
visual discontinuities as column widths are adjusted. If you want to
ensure perfect alignment, at the cost of more time and memory, use the
`--align-all` flag.

The `--historical`/`-H` flag adds the balance from any undisplayed prior
postings to the running total. This is useful when you want to see only
recent activity, with a historically accurate running balance:

``` shell
$ hledger register checking -b 2008/6 --historical
2008/06/01 gift                 assets:bank:checking            $1           $2
2008/06/02 save                 assets:bank:checking           $-1           $1
2008/12/31 pay off              assets:bank:checking           $-1            0
```

The `--depth` option limits the amount of sub-account detail displayed.

The `--average`/`-A` flag shows the running average posting amount
instead of the running total (so, the final number displayed is the
average for the whole report period). This flag implies `--empty` (see
below). It is affected by `--historical`. It works best when showing
just one account and one commodity.

The `--related`/`-r` flag shows the *other* postings in the transactions
of the postings which would normally be shown.

The `--invert` flag negates all amounts. For example, it can be used on
an income account where amounts are normally displayed as negative
numbers. It\'s also useful to show postings on the checking account
together with the related account:

``` shell
$ hledger register --related --invert assets:checking
```

With a [reporting interval](#reporting-interval), register shows summary
postings, one per interval, aggregating the postings to each account:

``` shell
$ hledger register --monthly income
2008/01                 income:salary                          $-1          $-1
2008/06                 income:gifts                           $-1          $-2
```

Periods with no activity, and summary postings with a zero amount, are
not shown by default; use the `--empty`/`-E` flag to see them:

``` shell
$ hledger register --monthly income -E
2008/01                 income:salary                          $-1          $-1
2008/02                                                          0          $-1
2008/03                                                          0          $-1
2008/04                                                          0          $-1
2008/05                                                          0          $-1
2008/06                 income:gifts                           $-1          $-2
2008/07                                                          0          $-2
2008/08                                                          0          $-2
2008/09                                                          0          $-2
2008/10                                                          0          $-2
2008/11                                                          0          $-2
2008/12                                                          0          $-2
```

Often, you\'ll want to see just one line per interval. The `--depth`
option helps with this, causing subaccounts to be aggregated:

``` shell
$ hledger register --monthly assets --depth 1h
2008/01                 assets                                  $1           $1
2008/06                 assets                                 $-1            0
2008/12                 assets                                 $-1          $-1
```

Note when using report intervals, if you specify start/end dates these
will be adjusted outward if necessary to contain a whole number of
intervals. This ensures that the first and last intervals are full
length and comparable to the others in the report.

With `-m DESC`/`--match=DESC`, register does a fuzzy search for one
recent posting whose description is most similar to DESC. DESC should
contain at least two characters. If there is no similar-enough match, no
posting will be shown and the program exit code will be non-zero.

#### Custom register output

register uses the full terminal width by default, except on windows. You
can override this by setting the `COLUMNS` environment variable (not a
bash shell variable) or by using the `--width`/`-w` option.

The description and account columns normally share the space equally
(about half of (width - 40) each). You can adjust this by adding a
description width as part of \--width\'s argument, comma-separated:
`--width W,D` . Here\'s a diagram (won\'t display correctly in \--help):

    <--------------------------------- width (W) ---------------------------------->
    date (10)  description (D)       account (W-41-D)     amount (12)   balance (12)
    DDDDDDDDDD dddddddddddddddddddd  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  AAAAAAAAAAAA  AAAAAAAAAAAA

and some examples:

``` shell
$ hledger reg                     # use terminal width (or 80 on windows)
$ hledger reg -w 100              # use width 100
$ COLUMNS=100 hledger reg         # set with one-time environment variable
$ export COLUMNS=100; hledger reg # set till session end (or window resize)
$ hledger reg -w 100,40           # set overall width 100, description width 40
$ hledger reg -w $COLUMNS,40      # use terminal width, & description width 40
```

This command also supports the [output
destination](hledger.html#output-destination) and [output
format](hledger.html#output-format) options The output formats supported
are `txt`, `csv`, and (experimental) `json`.

### rewrite

Print all transactions, rewriting the postings of matched transactions.
For now the only rewrite available is adding new postings, like print
\--auto.

This is a start at a generic rewriter of transaction entries. It reads
the default journal and prints the transactions, like print, but adds
one or more specified postings to any transactions matching QUERY. The
posting amounts can be fixed, or a multiplier of the existing
transaction\'s first posting amount.

Examples:

``` shell
$ hledger-rewrite.hs ^income --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33  ; income tax' --add-posting '(reserve:gifts)  $100'
$ hledger-rewrite.hs expenses:gifts --add-posting '(reserve:gifts)  *-1"'
$ hledger-rewrite.hs -f rewrites.hledger
```

rewrites.hledger may consist of entries like:

``` journal
= ^income amt:<0 date:2017
  (liabilities:tax)  *0.33  ; tax on income
  (reserve:grocery)  *0.25  ; reserve 25% for grocery
  (reserve:)  *0.25  ; reserve 25% for grocery
```

Note the single quotes to protect the dollar sign from bash, and the two
spaces between account and amount.

More:

``` shell
$ hledger rewrite -- [QUERY]        --add-posting "ACCT  AMTEXPR" ...
$ hledger rewrite -- ^income        --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33'
$ hledger rewrite -- expenses:gifts --add-posting '(budget:gifts)  *-1"'
$ hledger rewrite -- ^income        --add-posting '(budget:foreign currency)  *0.25 JPY; diversify'
```

Argument for `--add-posting` option is a usual posting of transaction
with an exception for amount specification. More precisely, you can use
`'*'` (star symbol) before the amount to indicate that that this is a
factor for an amount of original matched posting. If the amount includes
a commodity name, the new posting amount will be in the new commodity;
otherwise, it will be in the matched posting amount\'s commodity.

#### Re-write rules in a file

During the run this tool will execute so called [\"Automated
Transactions\"](http://ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Automated-Transactions)
found in any journal it process. I.e instead of specifying this
operations in command line you can put them in a journal file.

``` shell
$ rewrite-rules.journal
```

Make contents look like this:

``` journal
= ^income
    (liabilities:tax)  *.33

= expenses:gifts
    budget:gifts  *-1
    assets:budget  *1
```

Note that `'='` (equality symbol) that is used instead of date in
transactions you usually write. It indicates the query by which you want
to match the posting to add new ones.

``` shell
$ hledger rewrite -- -f input.journal -f rewrite-rules.journal > rewritten-tidy-output.journal
```

This is something similar to the commands pipeline:

``` shell
$ hledger rewrite -- -f input.journal '^income' --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33' \
  | hledger rewrite -- -f - expenses:gifts      --add-posting 'budget:gifts  *-1'       \
                                                --add-posting 'assets:budget  *1'       \
  > rewritten-tidy-output.journal
```

It is important to understand that relative order of such entries in
journal is important. You can re-use result of previously added
postings.

#### Diff output format

To use this tool for batch modification of your journal files you may
find useful output in form of unified diff.

``` shell
$ hledger rewrite -- --diff -f examples/sample.journal '^income' --add-posting '(liabilities:tax)  *.33'
```

Output might look like:

    --- /tmp/examples/sample.journal
    +++ /tmp/examples/sample.journal
    @@ -18,3 +18,4 @@
     2008/01/01 income

    +    (liabilities:tax)                0

If you\'ll pass this through `patch` tool you\'ll get transactions
containing the posting that matches your query be updated. Note that
multiple files might be update according to list of input files
specified via `--file` options and `include` directives inside of these
files.

Be careful. Whole transaction being re-formatted in a style of output
from `hledger print`.

#### rewrite vs. print \--auto

This command predates print \--auto, and currently does much the same
thing, but with these differences:

-   with multiple files, rewrite lets rules in any file affect all other
    files. print \--auto uses standard directive scoping; rules affect
    only child files.

-   rewrite\'s query limits which transactions can be rewritten; all are
    printed. print \--auto\'s query limits which transactions are
    printed.

-   rewrite applies rules specified on command line or in the journal.
    print \--auto applies rules specified in the journal.

### roi

Shows the time-weighted (TWR) and money-weighted (IRR) rate of return on
your investments.

At a minimum, you need to supply a query (which could be just an account
name) to select your investment(s) with `--inv`, and another query to
identify your profit and loss transactions with `--pnl`.

If you do not record changes in the value of your investment manually,
or do not require computation of time-weighted return (TWR), `--pnl`
could be an empty query (`--pnl ""` or `--pnl STR` where `STR` does not
match any of your accounts).

This command will compute and display the internalized rate of return
(IRR) and time-weighted rate of return (TWR) for your investments for
the time period requested. Both rates of return are annualized before
display, regardless of the length of reporting interval.

Price directives will be taken into account if you supply appropriate
`--cost` or `--value` flags (see
[VALUATION](https://hledger.org/hledger.html#valuation)).

Note, in some cases this report can fail, for these reasons:

-   Error (NotBracketed): No solution for Internal Rate of Return (IRR).
    Possible causes: IRR is huge (\>1000000%), balance of investment
    becomes negative at some point in time.
-   Error (SearchFailed): Failed to find solution for Internal Rate of
    Return (IRR). Either search does not converge to a solution, or
    converges too slowly.

Examples:

-   Using roi to compute total return of investment in stocks:
    <https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger/blob/master/examples/investing/roi-unrealised.ledger>

-   Cookbook \> Return on Investment: <https://hledger.org/roi.html>

#### Spaces and special characters in `--inv` and `--pnl`

Note that `--inv` and `--pnl`\'s argument is a query, and queries could
have several space-separated terms (see
[QUERIES](https://hledger.org/hledger.html#queries)).

To indicate that all search terms form single command-line argument, you
will need to put them in quotes (see [Special
characters](https://hledger.org/hledger.html#special-characters)):

``` shell
$ hledger roi --inv 'term1 term2 term3 ...'
```

If any query terms contain spaces themselves, you will need an extra
level of nested quoting, eg:

``` shell
$ hledger roi --inv="'Assets:Test 1'" --pnl="'Equity:Unrealized Profit and Loss'"
```

#### Semantics of `--inv` and `--pnl`

Query supplied to `--inv` has to match all transactions that are related
to your investment. Transactions not matching `--inv` will be ignored.

In these transactions, ROI will conside postings that match `--inv` to
be \"investment postings\" and other postings (not matching `--inv`)
will be sorted into two categories: \"cash flow\" and \"profit and
loss\", as ROI needs to know which part of the investment value is your
contributions and which is due to the return on investment.

-   \"Cash flow\" is depositing or withdrawing money, buying or selling
    assets, or otherwise converting between your investment commodity
    and any other commodity. Example:

        2019-01-01 Investing in Snake Oil
          assets:cash          -$100
          investment:snake oil

        2020-01-01 Selling my Snake Oil
          assets:cash           $10
          investment:snake oil  = 0

-   \"Profit and loss\" is change in the value of your investment:

        2019-06-01 Snake Oil falls in value
          investment:snake oil  = $57
          equity:unrealized profit or loss

All non-investment postings are assumed to be \"cash flow\", unless they
match `--pnl` query. Changes in value of your investment due to \"profit
and loss\" postings will be considered as part of your investment
return.

Example: if you use `--inv snake --pnl equity:unrealized`, then postings
in the example below would be classifed as:

    2019-01-01 Snake Oil #1
      assets:cash          -$100   ; cash flow posting
      investment:snake oil         ; investment posting

    2019-03-01 Snake Oil #2
      equity:unrealized pnl  -$100 ; profit and loss posting
      snake oil                    ; investment posting

#### IRR and TWR explained

\"ROI\" stands for \"return on investment\". Traditionally this was
computed as a difference between current value of investment and its
initial value, expressed in percentage of the initial value.

However, this approach is only practical in simple cases, where
investments receives no in-flows or out-flows of money, and where rate
of growth is fixed over time. For more complex scenarios you need
different ways to compute rate of return, and this command implements
two of them: IRR and TWR.

Internal rate of return, or \"IRR\" (also called \"money-weighted rate
of return\") takes into account effects of in-flows and out-flows.
Naively, if you are withdrawing from your investment, your future gains
would be smaller (in absolute numbers), and will be a smaller percentage
of your initial investment, and if you are adding to your investment,
you will receive bigger absolute gains (but probably at the same rate of
return). IRR is a way to compute rate of return for each period between
in-flow or out-flow of money, and then combine them in a way that gives
you a compound annual rate of return that investment is expected to
generate.

As mentioned before, in-flows and out-flows would be any cash that you
personally put in or withdraw, and for the \"roi\" command, these are
the postings that match the query in the`--inv` argument and NOT match
the query in the`--pnl` argument.

If you manually record changes in the value of your investment as
transactions that balance them against \"profit and loss\" (or
\"unrealized gains\") account or use price directives, then in order for
IRR to compute the precise effect of your in-flows and out-flows on the
rate of return, you will need to record the value of your investement on
or close to the days when in- or out-flows occur.

In technical terms, IRR uses the same approach as computation of net
present value, and tries to find a discount rate that makes net present
value of all the cash flows of your investment to add up to zero. This
could be hard to wrap your head around, especially if you haven\'t done
discounted cash flow analysis before. Implementation of IRR in hledger
should produce results that match the `XIRR` formula in Excel.

Second way to compute rate of return that `roi` command implements is
called \"time-weighted rate of return\" or \"TWR\". Like IRR, it will
also break the history of your investment into periods between in-flows,
out-flows and value changes, to compute rate of return per each period
and then a compound rate of return. However, internal workings of TWR
are quite different.

TWR represents your investment as an imaginary \"unit fund\" where
in-flows/ out-flows lead to buying or selling \"units\" of your
investment and changes in its value change the value of \"investment
unit\". Change in \"unit price\" over the reporting period gives you
rate of return of your investment.

### stats

Show journal and performance statistics.

The stats command displays summary information for the whole journal, or
a matched part of it. With a [reporting interval](#reporting-interval),
it shows a report for each report period.

At the end, it shows (in the terminal) the overall run time and number
of transactions processed per second. Note these are approximate and
will vary based on machine, current load, data size, hledger version,
haskell lib versions, GHC version.. but they may be of interest. The
`stats` command\'s run time is similar to that of a single-column
balance report.

Example:

``` shell
$ hledger stats -f examples/1000x1000x10.journal
Main file                : /Users/simon/src/hledger/examples/1000x1000x10.journal
Included files           : 
Transactions span        : 2000-01-01 to 2002-09-27 (1000 days)
Last transaction         : 2002-09-26 (6995 days ago)
Transactions             : 1000 (1.0 per day)
Transactions last 30 days: 0 (0.0 per day)
Transactions last 7 days : 0 (0.0 per day)
Payees/descriptions      : 1000
Accounts                 : 1000 (depth 10)
Commodities              : 26 (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)
Market prices            : 1000 (A)

Run time                 : 0.12 s
Throughput               : 8342 txns/s
```

This command supports the
[-o/\--output-file](hledger.html#output-destination) option (but not
[-O/\--output-format](hledger.html#output-format) selection).

### tags

List the tags used in the journal, or their values.

This command lists the tag names used in the journal, whether on
transactions, postings, or account declarations.

With a TAGREGEX argument, only tag names matching this regular
expression (case insensitive, infix matched) are shown.

With QUERY arguments, only transactions and accounts matching this query
are considered. If the query involves transaction fields (date:, desc:,
amt:, \...), the search is restricted to the matched transactions and
their accounts.

With the \--values flag, the tags\' unique non-empty values are listed
instead. With -E/\--empty, blank/empty values are also shown.

With \--parsed, tags or values are shown in the order they were parsed,
with duplicates included. (Except, tags from account declarations are
always shown first.)

Tip: remember, accounts also acquire tags from their parents, postings
also acquire tags from their account and transaction, transactions also
acquire tags from their postings.

### test

Run built-in unit tests.

This command runs the unit tests built in to hledger and hledger-lib,
printing the results on stdout. If any test fails, the exit code will be
non-zero.

This is mainly used by hledger developers, but you can also use it to
sanity-check the installed hledger executable on your platform. All
tests are expected to pass - if you ever see a failure, please report as
a bug!

This command also accepts tasty test runner options, written after a \--
(double hyphen). Eg to run only the tests in Hledger.Data.Amount, with
ANSI colour codes disabled:

``` shell
$ hledger test -- -pData.Amount --color=never
```

For help on these, see https://github.com/feuerbach/tasty#options
(`-- --help` currently doesn\'t show them).

## PART 5: COMMON TASKS

Here are some quick examples of how to do some basic tasks with hledger.

### Getting help

Here\'s how to list commands and view options and command docs:

``` shell
$ hledger                # show available commands
$ hledger --help         # show common options
$ hledger CMD --help     # show CMD's options, common options and CMD's documentation
```

You can also view your hledger version\'s manual in several formats by
using the [help command](#help). Eg:

``` shell
$ hledger help           # show the hledger manual with info, man or $PAGER (best available)
$ hledger help journal   # show the journal topic in the hledger manual
$ hledger help --help    # find out more about the help command
```

To view manuals and introductory docs on the web, visit
<https://hledger.org>. Chat and mail list support and discussion
archives can be found at <https://hledger.org/support>.

### Constructing command lines

hledger has a flexible command line interface. We strive to keep it
simple and ergonomic, but if you run into one of the sharp edges
described in [OPTIONS](#options), here are some tips that might help:

-   command-specific options must go after the command (it\'s fine to
    put common options there too: `hledger CMD OPTS ARGS`)
-   running add-on executables directly simplifies command line parsing
    (`hledger-ui OPTS ARGS`)
-   enclose \"problematic\" args in single quotes
-   if needed, also add a backslash to hide regular expression
    metacharacters from the shell
-   to see how a misbehaving command line is being parsed, add
    `--debug=2`.

### Starting a journal file

hledger looks for your accounting data in a journal file,
`$HOME/.hledger.journal` by default:

``` shell
$ hledger stats
The hledger journal file "/Users/simon/.hledger.journal" was not found.
Please create it first, eg with "hledger add" or a text editor.
Or, specify an existing journal file with -f or LEDGER_FILE.
```

You can override this by setting the `LEDGER_FILE` environment variable
(see below). It\'s a good practice to keep this important file under
version control, and to start a new file each year. So you could do
something like this:

``` shell
$ mkdir ~/finance
$ cd ~/finance
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/simon/finance/.git/
$ touch 2023.journal
$ echo "export LEDGER_FILE=$HOME/finance/2023.journal" >> ~/.profile
$ source ~/.profile
$ hledger stats
Main file                : /Users/simon/finance/2023.journal
Included files           : 
Transactions span        :  to  (0 days)
Last transaction         : none
Transactions             : 0 (0.0 per day)
Transactions last 30 days: 0 (0.0 per day)
Transactions last 7 days : 0 (0.0 per day)
Payees/descriptions      : 0
Accounts                 : 0 (depth 0)
Commodities              : 0 ()
Market prices            : 0 ()
```

### Setting LEDGER_FILE

How to set `LEDGER_FILE` permanently depends on your setup:

On unix and mac, running these commands in the terminal will work for
many people; adapt as needed:

``` shell
$ echo 'export LEDGER_FILE=~/finance/2023.journal` >> ~/.profile
$ source ~/.profile
```

When correctly configured, in a new terminal window
`env | grep LEDGER_FILE` will show your file, and so will
`hledger files`.

On mac, this additional step might be helpful for GUI applications (like
Emacs started from the dock): add an entry to
`~/.MacOSX/environment.plist` like

``` json
{
  "LEDGER_FILE" : "~/finance/2023.journal"
}
```

and then run `killall Dock` in a terminal window (or restart the
machine).

On Windows, see <https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html>, or
try running these commands in a powershell window (let us know if it
persists across a reboot, and if you need to be an Administrator):

``` shell
> CD
> MKDIR finance
> SETX LEDGER_FILE "C:\Users\USERNAME\finance\2023.journal"
```

### Setting opening balances

Pick a starting date for which you can look up the balances of some
real-world assets (bank accounts, wallet..) and liabilities (credit
cards..).

To avoid a lot of data entry, you may want to start with just one or two
accounts, like your checking account or cash wallet; and pick a recent
starting date, like today or the start of the week. You can always come
back later and add more accounts and older transactions, eg going back
to january 1st.

Add an opening balances transaction to the journal, declaring the
balances on this date. Here are two ways to do it:

-   The first way: open the journal in any text editor and save an entry
    like this:

    ``` journal
    2023-01-01 * opening balances
        assets:bank:checking                $1000   = $1000
        assets:bank:savings                 $2000   = $2000
        assets:cash                          $100   = $100
        liabilities:creditcard               $-50   = $-50
        equity:opening/closing balances
    ```

    These are start-of-day balances, ie whatever was in the account at
    the end of the previous day.

    The \* after the date is an optional status flag. Here it means
    \"cleared & confirmed\".

    The currency symbols are optional, but usually a good idea as
    you\'ll be dealing with multiple currencies sooner or later.

    The = amounts are optional balance assertions, providing extra error
    checking.

-   The second way: run `hledger add` and follow the prompts to record a
    similar transaction:

    ``` shell
    $ hledger add
    Adding transactions to journal file /Users/simon/finance/2023.journal
    Any command line arguments will be used as defaults.
    Use tab key to complete, readline keys to edit, enter to accept defaults.
    An optional (CODE) may follow transaction dates.
    An optional ; COMMENT may follow descriptions or amounts.
    If you make a mistake, enter < at any prompt to go one step backward.
    To end a transaction, enter . when prompted.
    To quit, enter . at a date prompt or press control-d or control-c.
    Date [2023-02-07]: 2023-01-01
    Description: * opening balances
    Account 1: assets:bank:checking
    Amount  1: $1000
    Account 2: assets:bank:savings
    Amount  2 [$-1000]: $2000
    Account 3: assets:cash
    Amount  3 [$-3000]: $100
    Account 4: liabilities:creditcard
    Amount  4 [$-3100]: $-50
    Account 5: equity:opening/closing balances
    Amount  5 [$-3050]: 
    Account 6 (or . or enter to finish this transaction): .
    2023-01-01 * opening balances
        assets:bank:checking                      $1000
        assets:bank:savings                       $2000
        assets:cash                                $100
        liabilities:creditcard                     $-50
        equity:opening/closing balances          $-3050

    Save this transaction to the journal ? [y]: 
    Saved.
    Starting the next transaction (. or ctrl-D/ctrl-C to quit)
    Date [2023-01-01]: .
    ```

If you\'re using version control, this could be a good time to commit
the journal. Eg:

``` shell
$ git commit -m 'initial balances' 2023.journal
```

### Recording transactions

As you spend or receive money, you can record these transactions using
one of the methods above (text editor, hledger add) or by using the
[hledger-iadd](#iadd) or [hledger-web](#web) add-ons, or by using the
[import command](#import) to convert CSV data downloaded from your bank.

Here are some simple transactions, see the hledger_journal(5) manual and
hledger.org for more ideas:

``` journal
2023/1/10 * gift received
  assets:cash   $20
  income:gifts

2023.1.12 * farmers market
  expenses:food    $13
  assets:cash

2023-01-15 paycheck
  income:salary
  assets:bank:checking    $1000
```

### Reconciling

Periodically you should reconcile - compare your hledger-reported
balances against external sources of truth, like bank statements or your
bank\'s website - to be sure that your ledger accurately represents the
real-world balances (and, that the real-world institutions have not made
a mistake!). This gets easy and fast with (1) practice and (2)
frequency. If you do it daily, it can take 2-10 minutes. If you let it
pile up, expect it to take longer as you hunt down errors and
discrepancies.

A typical workflow:

1.  Reconcile cash. Count what\'s in your wallet. Compare with what
    hledger reports (`hledger bal cash`). If they are different, try to
    remember the missing transaction, or look for the error in the
    already-recorded transactions. A register report can be helpful
    (`hledger reg cash`). If you can\'t find the error, add an
    adjustment transaction. Eg if you have \$105 after the above, and
    can\'t explain the missing \$2, it could be:

    ``` journal
    2023-01-16 * adjust cash
        assets:cash    $-2 = $105
        expenses:misc
    ```

2.  Reconcile checking. Log in to your bank\'s website. Compare today\'s
    (cleared) balance with hledger\'s cleared balance
    (`hledger bal checking -C`). If they are different, track down the
    error or record the missing transaction(s) or add an adjustment
    transaction, similar to the above. Unlike the cash case, you can
    usually compare the transaction history and running balance from
    your bank with the one reported by `hledger reg checking -C`. This
    will be easier if you generally record transaction dates quite
    similar to your bank\'s clearing dates.

3.  Repeat for other asset/liability accounts.

Tip: instead of the register command, use hledger-ui to see a
live-updating register while you edit the journal:
`hledger-ui --watch --register checking -C`

After reconciling, it could be a good time to mark the reconciled
transactions\' status as \"cleared and confirmed\", if you want to track
that, by adding the `*` marker. Eg in the paycheck transaction above,
insert `*` between `2023-01-15` and `paycheck`

If you\'re using version control, this can be another good time to
commit:

``` shell
$ git commit -m 'txns' 2023.journal
```

### Reporting

Here are some basic reports.

Show all transactions:

``` shell
$ hledger print
2023-01-01 * opening balances
    assets:bank:checking                      $1000
    assets:bank:savings                       $2000
    assets:cash                                $100
    liabilities:creditcard                     $-50
    equity:opening/closing balances          $-3050

2023-01-10 * gift received

                $-20    gifts
              $-1000    salary
                $-50  liabilities:creditcard
--------------------
                   0
```

Show only asset and liability balances, as a flat list, limited to depth
2:

``` shell
$ hledger bal assets liabilities -2
               $4000  assets:bank
                $105  assets:cash
                $-50  liabilities:creditcard
--------------------
               $4055
```

Show the same thing without negative numbers, formatted as a simple
balance sheet:

``` shell
$ hledger bs -2
Balance Sheet 2023-01-16

                        || 2023-01-16 
========================++============
 Assets                 ||            
------------------------++------------
 assets:bank            ||      $4000 
 assets:cash            ||       $105 
------------------------++------------
                        ||      $4105 
========================++============
 Liabilities            ||            
------------------------++------------
 liabilities:creditcard ||        $50 
------------------------++------------
                        ||        $50 
========================++============
 Net:                   ||      $4055 
```

The final total is your \"net worth\" on the end date. (Or use `bse` for
a full balance sheet with equity.)

Show income and expense totals, formatted as an income statement:

``` shell
hledger is 
Income Statement 2023-01-01-2023-01-16

               || 2023-01-01-2023-01-16 
===============++=======================
 Revenues      ||                       
---------------++-----------------------
 income:gifts  ||                   $20 
 income:salary ||                 $1000

 expenses:food ||                   $13 
 expenses:misc ||                    $2 
---------------++-----------------------
               ||                   $15 
===============++=======================
 Net:          ||                 $1005 
```

The final total is your net income during this period.

Show transactions affecting your wallet, with running total:

``` shell
$ hledger register cash
2023-01-01 opening balances     assets:cash                   $100          $100
2023-01-10 gift received        assets:cash                    $20          $120
2023-01-12 farmers market       assets:cash                   $-13          $107
2023-01-16 adjust cash          assets:cash                    $-2          $105
```

Show weekly posting counts as a bar chart:

``` shell
$ hledger activity -W
2019-12-30 *****
2023-01-06 ****
2023-01-13 ****
```

### Migrating to a new file

At the end of the year, you may want to continue your journal in a new
file, so that old transactions don\'t slow down or clutter your reports,
and to help ensure the integrity of your accounting history. See the
[close command](#close).

If using version control, don\'t forget to `git add` the new file.

## BUGS

We welcome bug reports in the hledger issue tracker (shortcut:
<http://bugs.hledger.org>), or on the #hledger chat or hledger mail list
(<https://hledger.org/support>).

Some known issues and limitations:

The need to precede add-on command options with `--` when invoked from
hledger is awkward. (See Command options, Constructing command lines.)

A UTF-8-aware system locale must be configured to work with non-ascii
data. (See Unicode characters, Troubleshooting.)

On Microsoft Windows, depending whether you are running in a CMD window
or a Cygwin/MSYS/Mintty window and how you installed hledger, non-ascii
characters and colours may not be supported, and the tab key may not be
supported by `hledger add`. (Running in a WSL window should resolve
these.)

When processing large data files, hledger uses more memory than Ledger.

### Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter when you run hledger,
and how to resolve them (and remember also you can usually get quick
[Support](support.md)):

**PATH issues: I get an error like \"No command \'hledger\' found\"**\
Depending how you installed hledger, the executables may not be in your
shell\'s PATH. Eg on unix systems, stack installs hledger in
`~/.local/bin` and cabal installs it in `~/.cabal/bin`. You may need to
add one of these directories to your shell\'s PATH, and/or open a new
terminal window.

**LEDGER_FILE issues: I configured LEDGER_FILE but hledger is not using
it**\

-   `LEDGER_FILE` should be a real environment variable, not just a
    shell variable. Eg on unix, the command `env | grep LEDGER_FILE`
    should show it. You may need to use `export` (see
    <https://stackoverflow.com/a/7411509>).
-   You may need to force your shell to see the new configuration. A
    simple way is to close your terminal window and open a new one.

**LANG issues: I get errors like \"Illegal byte sequence\" or \"Invalid
or incomplete multibyte or wide character\" or \"commitAndReleaseBuffer:
invalid argument (invalid character)\"**\
Programs compiled with GHC (hledger, haskell build tools, etc.) need the
system locale to be UTF-8-aware, or they will fail when they encounter
non-ascii characters. To fix it, set the LANG environment variable to a
locale which supports UTF-8 and which is installed on your system.

On unix, `locale -a` lists the installed locales. Look for one which
mentions `utf8`, `UTF-8` or similar. Some examples: `C.UTF-8`,
`en_US.utf-8`, `fr_FR.utf8`. If necessary, use your system package
manager to install one. Then select it by setting the `LANG` environment
variable. Note, exact spelling and capitalisation of the locale name may
be important: Here\'s one common way to configure this permanently for
your shell:

``` shell
$ echo "export LANG=en_US.utf8" >>~/.profile
# close and re-open terminal window
```

**COMPATIBILITY ISSUES: hledger gives an error with my Ledger file**\
Not all of Ledger\'s journal file syntax or feature set is supported.
