# Easy workflow #3: hledger-ui

[hledger-ui](hledger-ui.html) is hledger's "curses-style" UI, ie a full-window terminal app.
It's fast, efficient, and slightly more powerful than the web UI.
One limitation: on Microsoft Windows, it can only be installed inside [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSL).
Screenshots below!

### Check your installation

Open a
[terminal](https://itconnect.uw.edu/learn/workshops/online-tutorials/web-publishing/what-is-a-terminal/)
or command prompt
and check your hledger-ui version.
It should be reasonably [up to date](release-notes.html). 
This doc was last tested with:
```shell
$ hledger-ui --version
hledger-ui 1.17.1.1
```

If this fails, check [download/install](download.html) for install and setup tips.

<!--
### Check usage

```shell
$ hledger-ui --help
hledger-ui [OPTIONS] [PATTERNS]
  browse accounts, postings and entries in a full-window curses interface

Flags:
     --watch               watch for data and date changes and reload
                           automatically
     --theme=THEME         use this custom display theme (default, greenterm,
                           terminal)
     --register=ACCTREGEX  start in the (first) matched account's register
     --change              show period balances (changes) at startup instead
                           of historical balances
  -F --flat                show accounts as a list (default)
  -T --tree                show accounts as a tree

General flags:
...
```
-->

### Start hledger-ui

Normally, you start hledger-ui by running `hledger-ui` in a terminal.
Any standard terminal app will do, but not a command prompt that
doesn't allow cursor positioning (such as an emacs shell buffer).
(In that case you'd see garbage output, like `^[(B^[(B──────────── tmp.journal account balances...`, 
and would have to press `q`, `RETURN` to exit.)

For this tutorial, we'll specify a new temporary journal file,
to suit the steps below and avoid disturbing any existing data:
```shell
$ echo > tmp.journal
$ hledger-ui -f tmp.journal
```

### A quick tour

With an empty journal, there's not much to see. But we can see: the
name of the journal file (`tmp.journal`) and the screen (`account balances`)
at the top:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%202.31.12%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%202.31.12%20PM.png)

And some quick help across the bottom, 
telling us that pressing `q` is a way to quit hledger-ui,
and pressing `a` is a way to add transactions.
Press `a`:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%202.31.31%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%202.31.31%20PM.png)

This bare-bones data entry UI is hledger's [add](hledger.html#add) command,
also introduced in [Easy workflow #1: hledger add](add.html).

Here, we'll use it to enter a few transactions, 
similar to the [quick start](index.html#quick-start) example.
After each prompt, type the value shown in white and press `RETURN`.

Note when we get to `Amount 2`, hledger guesses that this is a two-posting transaction
and as a default value offers the amount that would balance the transaction (`$-1234`):
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.06.07%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.06.07%20PM.png)

In such cases we can press `TAB` to enter the default value, with an opportunity to edit it before pressing `RETURN`:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.09.03%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.09.03%20PM.png)

Or just press `RETURN` to use it.
At this point transaction is balanced, and so we have the option to end the transaction. Press `RETURN` (enter) to do that:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.09.17%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.09.17%20PM.png)

We get one more opportunity to preview the resulting journal entry. 
Press `RETURN` again to accept the default answer (`y`):
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.09.27%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.09.27%20PM.png)

When we see "`Saved.`", we know the entry has been written (appended) to the journal file.
And we get another Date prompt, ready to enter another transaction:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.09.32%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.09.32%20PM.png)

Continue entering the values shown in white (`2020-03-15`, `client payment`..).
This time, based on the description, hledger has picked a "similar transaction",
which will supply defaults for the following prompts. Eg `assets:checking` for `Account 1`.
That's what we want, so press `RETURN` to accept it:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.09.46%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.09.46%20PM.png)

The next defaults (`$1234`, `equity`..) are not what we want,
so ignore them and continue entering the values shown (`$2000`, `income:consulting`..):
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.10.06%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.10.06%20PM.png)

And as before, press `RETURN` a few times to finish and save this transaction:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.10.15%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.10.15%20PM.png)

Enter the values for the final transaction (`2020-03-20`, `Sprouts`..).
Note, we don't accept the default for `Amount 2`, 
so the transaction remains unbalanced, and we can continue on, 
to enter the third posting:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.10.44%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.10.44%20PM.png)

When entering a value we've used before, we can type just the start of
it and press `TAB` to auto-complete the rest, saving some work:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.10.50%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.10.50%20PM.png)

<!-- [![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.10.55%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.10.55%20PM.png) -->

Complete this transaction, and this time at the Date prompt enter `.` (period) and `RETURN` to end data entry:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.11.02%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.11.02%20PM.png)

We have returned to hledger-ui, and now we see the accounts and their ending balances:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.11.17%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.11.17%20PM.png)

Press `DOWN` (down arrow) to move the selection (the yellow highlight) to the `assets:checking` account:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.11.23%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.11.23%20PM.png)

Press `RIGHT` to "drill in" to see the transactions in `assets:checking` ("register" screen).
The third column shows the other account(s) involved, abbreviated when necessary.
The last column is the account's running balance:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.11.33%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.11.33%20PM.png)

Press `RIGHT` again to see the selected transaction's journal entry ("transaction" screen).
We can see this is transaction number 3 in the journal, and also number 3 of 3 in the `assets:checking` account:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.12.13%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.12.13%20PM.png)

On this screen we can use the up and down arrows to step back and forth through transactions.
Press `UP`. Now we're at transaction number 2:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.12.27%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.12.27%20PM.png)

Press `LEFT` to go back to the previous screen (`assets:checking`'s register):
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.12.45%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.12.45%20PM.png)

And `LEFT` again to go back to the top screen (accounts):
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.13.06%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.13.06%20PM.png)

Press `T` (capital T) to switch from "flat mode" to "tree mode". This shows the account hierarchy more clearly:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.13.56%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.13.56%20PM.png)

With a lot of accounts, sometimes you want to see less detail. 
Press the `-` (minus) key once to reduce the account depth limit by 1.
Now the `expenses:food:groceries` subaccount (depth 3) has been hidden,
and the heading says "`to depth 2`":
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.14.11%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.14.11%20PM.png)

Press the `-` key once more, reducing the depth limit to 1:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.14.15%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.14.15%20PM.png)

We could press `+` to increase the depth again, or a number key to set it directly.
Press `9` to make it "unlimited", removing the depth limit:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.14.34%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.14.34%20PM.png)

Press the `/` (forward slash) key to enter a filter query.
A `filter:` prompt appears at the bottom:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.15.11%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.15.11%20PM.png)

Let's filter for accounts with "`checking`" in their name. Type `checking` and press `RETURN`:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.17.56%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.17.56%20PM.png)

Now only `assets:checking` is shown.
(And its parent `assets` account, because we're in tree mode):
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.17.59%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.17.59%20PM.png)

Press `RIGHT` to see the register for the `assets` account.
Note, while there are no transactions directly referencing the `assets` account,
the transactions of its subaccount `assets:checking` are shown, because we're in tree mode.
(In flat mode, they wouldn't be.
That's what the `T:flat(-subs)/tree(+subs)` in the help line is about.):
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.18.30%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.18.30%20PM.png)

On a register screen, the `SHIFT-DOWN`/`SHIFT-UP` keys shrink/expand the time period being shown.
By default, the register shows all of the account's transactions.
Hold down `SHIFT` and press the `DOWN` arrow once. Not much has changed,
but now the heading says "`in 2020`"
(at least, if you are doing this in the year 2020..).
The report period has shrunk to "the current year":
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.18.37%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.18.37%20PM.png)

Press `SHIFT-DOWN` again. Now it says "`in 2020q1`"
(at least, if you are doing this in the first quarter of 2020..).
The report period has shrunk to "the current quarter of the current year":
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.18.39%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.18.39%20PM.png)

Press `SHIFT-DOWN` again. The next smaller period is "the current month",
and (at least, if you are doing this in March, 2020..) 
the heading now says `2020/03`, and now we can see that only 2
of the transactions are in March:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.18.45%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.18.45%20PM.png)

When the report period has been shrunk in this way,
the `SHIFT-LEFT`/`SHIFT-RIGHT` keys move backward/forward in time.
So pressing `SHIFT-LEFT` now should take you to the previous month (`2020-02`).
There are no transactions in this month.
(ignore the columns of dots; it's a display bug):
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.18.52%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.18.52%20PM.png)

Press `SHIFT-LEFT` once more to show the previous month (`2020-01`),
where we can see the single January transaction:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.18.55%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.18.55%20PM.png)

To expand the report period again, press `SHIFT-UP` several times,
until the "`in ...`" suffix disappears from the heading:
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.19.57%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.19.57%20PM.png)

Press the `ESC` (escape) key - this is another way to return to the top screen,
and also clears any filter query.
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.20.11%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.20.11%20PM.png)

Pressing the `?` key shows a more detailed help dialog. 
To close it, press `?` again, or `ESC`.
[![](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.20.27%20PM.png)](/_static/ui/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-24%20at%203.20.27%20PM.png)

While the help dialog is open, you can press `p`, `m` or `i`
to see the [hledger-ui](hledger-ui.html) user manual in several offline formats
(useful if you can't access the web version).

The formats are: plain text (`p`), using your $PAGER for scrolling if possible:

Press `q` to return to hledger-ui.
