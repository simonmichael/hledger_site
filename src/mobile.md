Entering expenses on the spot using a mobile device can be convenient. 
One of the challenges is finding apps that focus on making this efficient. 

<https://plaintextaccounting.org/#ui-mobile> is the up to date list of PTA-specific mobile apps.
Most of these are focussed on data entry, then export to a computer for reporting.

## hledger-compatible apps

### NanoLedger (Android, 2023-)

<https://github.com/chvp/NanoLedger>\
<https://f-droid.org/packages/be.chvp.nanoledger>\

Exports a h/ledger journal.

### Cashier II (progressive web app, 2022-2024)

### Cashier, Cashier II (progressive web apps, 2022-2024)

Cashier:\

[demo](https://cashier.alensiljak.eu.org)

Cashier II:\
<https://github.com/alensiljak/cashier-blazor>\
[demo](https://cashier-ii.alensiljak.eu.org)

These can be used on a computer or a phone, including offline. 
They can optionally import data from h/ledger using a [server](https://github.com/alensiljak/cashier-server-rust).
They export a new h/ledger journal.
They also provide some reports.

### MoLe (Android, 2018-2024)

<https://mole.ktnx.net>\
<https://git.ktnx.net/?p=mobile-ledger.git>

Connects to a hledger-web server, which you must have running somewhere your phone can connect to (eg a VPS or a VPN).
Ie it can potentially add transactions directly into your main accounting system, without needing an export/import step.

### Cone (Android, 2019-2021)

<https://github.com/bradyt/cone>\
<https://f-droid.org/packages/info.tangential.cone>\
[blog](https://www.chvp.be/blog/nanoledger)

Exports a h/ledger journal.
According to NanoLedger's blog post, it had some bugs when the journal file is synced with Nextcloud, and lags if the file is pretty big.
There was a [report](https://www.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/comments/17sielr/nanoledger_android_app_for_data_entry_with) of data corruption.

Cone vs NanoLedger:

| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Journal view screen      | Transactions can be sorted by new to old or reversed, and elements are colored | Transactions can only be sorted by new to old, and elements aren't colored           |
| Transaction entry screen | The description field is free form                                           | The description field is split into status field, payee field and note field         |
| Modify old transaction   | No                                                                             | Yes. You can edit or delete old transaction, or use it as the template for a new one |


## Apps with CSV export

Many other apps can export CSV, which hledger can read.

The usual workflow is that every so often you manually initiate a CSV export from the app.
Often the app starts up a temporary HTTP server, and you can fetch the data to your computer with curl.
Then you can use hledger's usual CSV-reading or importing features.
