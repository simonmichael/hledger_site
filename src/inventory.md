# Inventory accounting

## Fundraiser

This example demonstrates accounting for a fundraiser where members sold
meat-sticks and chocolate bars. The local organization would check out
inventory, sell it, and then pay the regional organization back for the
fundraising goods they sold.

In this particular example chocolate bars are sold for $2 and meat-sticks
are sold for $1. The local organization gets to keep 30% of the proceeds.

The role of the first three accounts are fairly straight-forward.
`assets:cash` tracks money in the cash box. `assets:inventory` tracks 
the unsold meat and chocolate stock. `liabilities:supplier` tracks
the money owed to the supplier.

The interesting account is `income:fundraiser`. This account summarizes
the effect of the fundraiser on the organization. In our example the
initial effect on the organization is that it acquired $61.60 of debt,
24 meat-sticks, and 32 chocolate bars. As the fundraiser progresses, this
account will hold only the $26.40 of income.

In the real use-case, the members of the organization would check out
product to sell. Additional transactions can be used to transfer stock
from the organization's inventory accounts to member-specific accounts.

1-3 * Bob | Sold more things
    assets:inventory              -4 MEAT
    assets:inventory             -20 CHOC
    assets:cash                   44 USD
    income:fundraiser

1-4 * Supplier | Pay balance
    liabilities:supplier       61.60 USD
    assets:cash               -61.60 USD
```

We can run a cumulative balance report to see the effect of the fundraiser
after each day in the example. Each day the inventory decreases and the
income account converts from borrowed product to cash income.

```shell
$ hledger bal -DH --pretty

To see the same information in terms of the cash-value of the inventory
that we're holding we can use the `-V` flag.  From this view we can the
income realized by the fundraiser as it progresses, and the cash value
of our current inventory.

For our fundraiser the members got credit for their contribution to the
fundraiser. By pivoting by payee we can see the gross revenue and inventory
sold by each member. The row for the supplier shows the total inventory
acquired and cost paid.

```shell
hledger bal income:fundraiser --pivot=payee --pretty -Y
Balance changes in 2021:

          ║                          2021

To see the net revenue attributed to each member, we can generate the same
report valued by the cost of the goods.

```shell
hledger bal income:fundraiser --pivot=payee --pretty -YV
