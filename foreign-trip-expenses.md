# Foreign trip expenses

From https://www.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/comments/9r9cfj/beancount_price_and_cost :

> 1. Before going to vacation to Europe, I borrowed 350 EUR, cash.
> 2. I also took out of ATM 200 EUR, cash - now I know the price.
> 3. I spent 500 EUR in trip, and I have 50 left.
> 4. Now, after the trip, I exchanged some of my home currency to 300 EUR to give it back - and it's the different price from step two.
> So how do I write all this down?

My attempt follows. Notes:
- When transactions occur on such trips, I sometimes know the USD amount spent, and sometimes the EUR amount. I sometimes know the total converted amount, and sometimes the conversion rate. I record whichever of these is more convenient.
- After the trip, when reviewing expenses, I'll add a P market price directive covering the period of the trip, and use -V to see all expenses in home currency (USD).

Here are a few different reports, for comparison:

Simple balance change report for all accounts. --flat and -Y help ensure a readable tabular layout here.
```
$ hledger bal --flat -Y
Balance changes in 2018:

                                  ||                 2018
==================================++======================
 Assets:Bank                      ||          -590.00 USD
 Expenses:Fees:CurrencyConversion ||            10.00 USD
 Expenses:Vacation:Food           ||              190 EUR

                                  || 500 EUR, -580.00 USD
```

Adding the -B/--cost flag converts transaction amounts to the other commodity in the transaction, using the conversion rate specified in the transaction if any. This typically helps collapse the grand total to one commodity, so we can see it is zero here (expected, since we're showing all accounts).
```
$ hledger bal --flat -Y -B
Balance changes in 2018:

                                  ||                 2018

```

Adding the -V/--value flag instead converts report amounts using the market price effective on the reporting date (hledger prices and date can help identify that). The grand total of -5 USD here corresponds to our capital loss due to change in exchange rate (the price of a euro went from $1.10 to $1.20 while we still owed some):
```
$ hledger prices
P 2018-10-25 EUR 1.15 USD

$ hledger bal --flat -Y -V

                                  ||   -5.00 USD
```

The "exp" account query is added to show just the expenses. Now we can see their total.
```
$ hledger bal --flat -Y -V exp

Or you might use the is/incomestatement command which is specialised for income/expense reporting.
It's tabular and flat by default.
